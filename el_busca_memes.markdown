While the brightest minds of Silicon Valley are “disrupting” whatever industry
is too crippled to fend off their advances, something odd is happening to our
language. Old, trusted words no longer mean what they used to mean; often, they
don’t mean anything at all. Our language, much like everything these days, has
been hacked. Fuzzy, contentious, and complex ideas have been stripped of their
subversive connotations and replaced by cleaner, shinier, and emptier
alternatives; long-running debates about politics, rights, and freedoms have
been recast in the seemingly natural language of economics, innovation, and
efficiency. Complexity, as it turns out, is not particularly viral.

Mientras las brillantes más mentes de Silicon Valley "desbaratan"[^disrupt]
cualquier industria demasiado débil para pararlas, algo raro está ocurriendo
con nuestro lenguaje.  Las viejas, confiables palabras ya no significan lo que
otrora;  a menudo no significan nada en absoluto.  Nuestro lenguaje, como todo
lo demás en estos días, ha sido hackeado.  Las ideas difusas, contenciosas y
complejas han sido despojadas de sus connotaciones subversivas y reemplazadas
por alternativas más limpias, brillantes y vacías;  los debates sobre política,
derechos y libertades han sido remoldadeados al lenguaje aparentemente natural
de la economía, la innovación y la eficiencia.  La complejidad, al final, no es
particularmente viral.

Fortunately, Silicon Valley, that never-drying well of shoddy concepts
and dubious paradigms—from wiki-everything to i-something, from
e-nothing to open-anything—is ready to help. Like a good priest, it’s
always there to console us with the promise of a better future, a
glitzier roadmap, a sleeker vocabulary.This is not to deny that many of
our latest gadgets and apps are fantastic. But to fixate on
technological innovation alone is to miss the more subtle—and more
consequential—ways in which a clique of techno-entrepreneurs has
hijacked our language and, with it, our reason. In the last decade or
so, Silicon Valley has triggered its own wave of linguistic innovation,
a wave so massive that a completely new way to analyze and describe the
world—a silicon mentality of sorts—has emerged in its wake. The old
language has been rendered useless; our pre-Internet vocabulary, we are
told, needs an upgrade.

Afortunadamente _Sillicon Valley_, esa fuente que no se seca de conceptos de
pacotilla y paradigmas dudosos --de wiki-todo a i-algo, de e-nada a
cualquier-cosa-abierta-- esta lista para ayudar.  Como un buen cura, está
siempre disponible para consolarnos con la promesa de un futuro mejor, un plan
más brillante, un vocabulario más pulcro.  Esto no niega que muchos de los
últimos dispositivos y _apps_ no son fantásticos.  Pero fijarse solo en la
innovación tecnológica significa perderse de las formas más sutiles --y con más
consecuencias-- en las que un grupito de tecnoemprendedores ha asaltado nuestro
lenguaje y con él, nuestra razón.  En la última decada, Silicon Valley ha
disparado su propia ola de innovación lingüística, una ola tan masiva que al
romper ha hecho emerger una nueva forma de analizar y describir el mundo --una
suerte de mentalidad de silicona.  El viejo lenguaje se ha vuelto inútil;
nuestro vocabulario pre-Internet, nos dicen, necesita una actualización.

Silicon Valley has always had a thing for priests; Steve Jobs was the
cranky pope it deserved. Today, having mastered the art of four-hour
workweeks and gluten-free lunches in outdoor cafeterias, our digital
ministers are beginning to preach on subjects far beyond the funky world
of drones, 3-D printers, and smart toothbrushes. That we would
eventually be robbed of a meaningful language to discuss technology was
entirely predictable. That the conceptual imperialism of Silicon Valley
would also pollute the rest of our vocabulary wasn’t.

Silicon Valley siempre ha tenido algo por los curas.  Steve Jobs fue el
irritable Papa que necesitaba.  Hoy en día, habiendo dominado el arte de la
semana laboral de cuatro horas y los almuerzos sin gluten en cafeterías al aire
libre, nuestros ministros digitales están empezando a predicar sobre asuntos
que sobrepasan el mundo de los drones, las impresoras 3D y los cepillos de
dientes inteligentes.  Que eventualmente fueramos robadas de un lenguaje con
significado para discutir sobre tecnología era predecible.  Que el imperialismo
conceptual de Silicon Valley terminaría contaminando el resto de nuestro
vocabulario no lo era.

The enduring emptiness of our technology debates has one main cause, and
his name is Tim O’Reilly. The founder and CEO of O’Reilly Media, a
seemingly omnipotent publisher of technology books and a tireless
organizer of trendy conferences, O’Reilly is one of the most influential
thinkers in Silicon Valley. Entire fields of thought—from computing to
management theory to public administration—have already surrendered to
his buzzwordophilia, but O’Reilly keeps pressing on. Over the past
fifteen years, he has given us such gems of analytical precision as
“open source,” “Web 2.0,” “government as a platform,” and “architecture
of participation.” O’Reilly doesn’t coin all of his favorite
expressions, but he promotes them with religious zeal and enviable
perseverance. While Washington prides itself on Frank Luntz, the
Republican strategist who rebranded “global warming” as “climate change”
and turned “estate tax” into “death tax,” Silicon Valley has found its
own Frank Luntz in Tim O’Reilly.

La duradera vacuidad de nuestros debates sobre la tecnología tiene una causa
principal y su nombre es Tim O'Reilly.  Fundador y CEO de O'Reilly Media,
editor aparentemente omnipotente de libros de tecnología y organizador
incansable de conferencias de moda, O'Reilly es uno de los pensadores más
influyentes de Silicon Valley.  Areas enteras del pensamiento --desde la
informatica a la teoria de administracion y la administracion publica-- ya se
han rendido a su palabrademodafilia[^buzzwordophilia], pero O'Reilly sigue
avanzando.  Durante los ultimos quince años nos ha entregado gemas de la
precision analitica como "open source" \[codigo abierto\], "web 2.0", "gobierno
como plataforma" y "arquitectura de participacion".  O'Reilly no solo acuña sus
expresiones favoritas, las promueve con celo religioso y envidiable
perseverancia.  Mientras Washington se vanagloria de tener a Frank Luntz, el
estrategista republicano que cambio "calentamiento global" por "cambio
climatico" y convirtio "impuesto a la propiedad" por "impuesto de muerte",
Silicon Valley ha encontrado su propio Frank Luntz en Tim O'Reilly.

Tracing O’Reilly’s intellectual footprint
is no easy task, in part because it’s so vast.<span
id="anchor1">[\[\*\]](http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/#footnote1)</span>
Through his books, blogs, and conferences, he’s nurtured a whole
generation of technology thinkers, from Clay Shirky to Cory Doctorow. A
prolific blogger and a [compulsive Twitter
user](https://twitter.com/timoreilly) with more than 1.6 million
followers, O’Reilly has a knack for writing articulate essays about
technological change. [His essay on “Web
2.0”](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1008839)
elucidated a basic philosophy of the Internet in a way accessible to
both academics and venture capitalists; it boasts more than [six
thousand
references](http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/%20https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&authuser=0#hl=en&authuser=0&sclient=psy-ab&q=%22What+is+Web+2.0:+Design+patterns+and+business+models+for+the+next+generation+of+software%22&oq=%22What+is+Web+2.0:+Design+patterns+and+business+models+for+the+next+generation+of+software%22&gs_l=serp.3..0j0i30l4.9871.10733.1.10940.3.3.0.0.0.0.66.170.3.3.0...0.0...1c.1.7.serp.ixWALPE7kd4&psj=1&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&fp=ed026ff60bd20b9e&biw=1280&bih=620)
on Google Scholar—not bad for a non-academic author. He also [invests in
start-ups](http://oatv.com/portfolio.html)—the very start-ups that he
celebrates in his public advocacy—through a[venture
fund](http://oatv.com/), which, like most things O’Reilly, also bears
his name.

Trazar las huellas intelectuales de O'Reilly no es una tarea facil, en parte
porque es muy vasta.  A traves de sus libros, blogs y conferencias ha
amamantado a una generacion entera de pensadores sobre la tecnologia, desde
Clay Shirky a Cory Doctorow.  Es un bloguero muy prolifico y un usuario
compulsivo de Twitter con mas de 1,6 millones de seguidores y tiene gusto por
escribir ensayos sobre el cambio tecnologico.  Su ensayo sobre la "web 2.0"
elucido una filosofia basica sobre Internet de una forma accesible tanto a
academicos como a capitalistas de riesgo y cuenta mas de seis mil referencias
en _Google Scholar.  Nada mal para un autor no academico.  Tambien invierte en
_startups_ --las mismas que celebra en su actividad publica-- a traves de un
fondo de riesgo que, como todas las cosas de O'Reilly, lleva su propio nombre.

A stylish and smooth-talking self-promoter with a philosophical take on
everything, O’Reilly is the Bernard-Henri Lévy of Route 101, the
favorite court philosopher of the TED elites. His impressive
intellectual stature in the Valley can probably be attributed to the
simple fact that he is much better read than your average tech
entrepreneur. His constant references to the learned men of
yesteryear—from “[Archilochus, the Greek
fabulist](http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/04/handicapping-internet-platform-wars.html)”
to [Ezra
Pound](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/05/google-wave-what-might-email-l.html)—make
him stand out from all those Silicon Valley college dropouts who don’t
know their Plotinus from their Pliny. A onetime recipient of a[National
Endowment for the Arts
grant](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.10/oreilly_pr.html) to
translate Greek fables—“[Socrates is \[one of\] my constant
companions](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/06/benefits-classical-education.html)”—he
has the air of a man ready to grapple with the Really Big Questions of
the Universe (his Harvard degree in classics certainly comes in handy).
While he recently [told
*Wired*](http://www.wired.com/business/2012/12/mf-tim-oreilly-qa/all/)
that he doesn’t “really give a shit if literary novels go away” because
“they’re an elitist pursuit,” O’Reilly is also quick to acknowledge that
novels have profoundly shaped his own life. In 1981 the young O’Reilly
even [wrote a reputable biography](http://oreilly.com/tim/herbert/) of
the science fiction writer Frank Herbert, the author of the *Dune*
series, in which he waxes lyrical about Martin Heidegger and Karl
Jaspers.

Como estilizado y suave auto-promotor con una vision filosofica sobre todo,
O'Reilly es el Bernard-Henri Levy de la Ruta 101 y el filosofo de la corte
favorito de las elites de TED.  Su impresionante estatura intelectual en el
Valley probablemente pueda ser atribuida al simple hecho de que esta mejor
leido que el tecnoemprendedor promedio.  Sus constantes referencias a los
educados hombres del pasado --desde Arquiloco, el fabulista griego a Ezra
Pound-- lo hacen resaltar sobre todos esos desertores universitarios de Silicon
Valley que no distinguen a Plotino de Plinio.  Una vez recibio una beca del
_National Endowment for the Arts_ para traducir fabulas griegas  --"Socrates es
[una de] mis compañias constantes"-- y tiene el aire de un hombre listo para
pelearse con las Grandes Preguntas del Universo (su titulo de Harvard en los
clasicos le viene muy bien.)  Aunque haya dicho en _Wired_ que "no me importa
una mierda que las novelas literarias desaparezcan" porque "son un interes
elitista", O'Reilly rapidamente reconoce que las novelas han formado
profundamente su vida.  Incluso en 1981 el joven O'Reilly escribia una
respetable biografia del escritor de ciencia ficcion Frank Herbert, autor de la
serie _Dune_, en la que habla de Martin Heidegger y Karl Jaspers.

Alas, O’Reilly and the dead Germans parted ways long ago. These days,
he’s busy changing the world; any list of unelected technocrats who are
shaping the future of American politics would have his name at the very
top. A Zelig-like presence on both sides of the Atlantic, he hobnobs
with government officials in Washington and London, advising them on the
Next Big Thing. [O’Reilly’s thinking on “Government
2.0”](http://oreilly.com/tim/gov2/) has influenced many bureaucrats in
the Obama administration, particularly those tasked with promoting the
amorphous ideal of “open government”—not an easy thing to do in an
administration bent on prosecuting whistle-blowers and dispatching
drones to “we-can’t-tell-you-where-exactly” destinations. O’Reilly is
also active in discussions about the [future of health
care](http://oreilly.com/tim/healthcare/), having strong views on what
“health 2.0” should be like.

No obstante O'Reilly y los alemanes muertos se han separado hace ya tiempo.  En
estos días está ocupado cambiando el mundo.  Cualquier lista de tecnócratas
inelectos que estén dándole forma al futuro de la política norteamericana
debería tener su nombre en el primer lugar.  Con una presencia a la Zelig en
ambos lados del Atlántico, O'Reilly se codea con oficiales gubernamentales de
Washington y Londres, dándoles consejo sobre la Próxima Gran Cosa.  [El
pensamiento de O'Reilly sobre el "Gobierno 2.0"](http://oreilly.com/tim/gov2/)
ha influenciado a muchos burócratas de la administración Obama, particularmente
aquellos cuya tarea es la promoción del ideal amorfo del "gobierno abierto",
algo no tan fácil de hacer dentro de un gobierno inclinado a judicializar a
soplonas y enviar _dones_ hacia "no-te-podemos-decir-exactamente-dónde".
O'Reilly también está activo en discusiones sobre el [futuro de la
salud](http://oreilly.com/tim/healthcare/), con fuertes visiones sobre cómo
debería ser la "Salud 2.0".

None of this is necessarily bad. On first impression, O’Reilly seems
like a much-needed voice of reason—even of civic spirit—in the shallow
and ruthless paradise-ghetto that is Silicon Valley. Compared to
ultra-libertarian technology mavens like Peter Thiel and Kevin Kelly,
O’Reilly might even be mistaken for a bleeding-heart liberal. He has
publicly [endorsed
Obama](http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/10/why-i-support-barack-obama.html)
and supported many of his key reforms. He has called on young software
developers—the galley slaves of Silicon Valley—to work on “[stuff that
matters](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html)”
(albeit preferably in the private sector). He has written favorably
about the work of little-known local officials transforming American
cities. [O’Reilly once
said](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonbruner/2011/03/25/tim-oreilly-on-piracy-tinkering-and-the-future-of-the-book/)
that his company’s vision is to “change the world by spreading the
knowledge of innovators,” while his own [personal
credo](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=3103) is
to “create more value than you capture.” (And he has certainly captured
a lot of it: his publishing empire, once in the humble business of
producing technical manuals, is now [worth \$100
million](https://plus.google.com/+TimOReilly/posts/Sy8Z2uWy655?hl=en).)
Helping like-minded people find each other, sharpen their message, form
a social movement, and change the world: this is what O’Reilly’s empire
is all about. [Its website even boasts](http://oreilly.com/) of its
“long history of advocacy, meme-making, and evangelism.” Who says that
spiritual gurus can’t have their own venture funds?

Nada de esto es necesariamente malo.  A primera vista, O'Reilly parece ser una
muy necesaria voz de la razón --incluso de espíritu cívico-- en el
paraíso-gueto superficial e implacable que es _Sillicon Valley_.  Comparado a
expertos de la tecnología ultra-libertarian como Peter Thiel y Kevin Kelly,
O'Reilly podría pasar por un progresista de corazón.  Incluso ha apoyado
públicamente a Obama y apoyado muchas de sus reformas clave.  Ha llamado a las
programadoras jóvenes --las remeras de la galera _Sillicon Valley_-- a trabajar
en "cosas que importen", aunque preferentemente en el sector privado.  Ha
escrito favorablemente sobre el trabajo de oficiales locales poco conocidos que
están transformando las ciudades estadounidenses.  O'Reilly alguna vez dijo que
la visión de su compañía es "cambiar el mundo mediante la difusión del
conocimiento de los innovadores" mientras que en su credo personal se trata de
"crear más valor del que capturas".  (Y ciertamente ha capturado un montón:  su
imperio editorial, otrora dedicado al humilde negocio de los manuales técnicos,
ahora vale unos $ 100 millones de dólares.)  Ayudar a personas con ideas
similares encontrarse entre sí, afilar su mensaje, formar un movimiento social
y cambiar el mundo:  esto es de lo que se trata el imperio de O'Reilly.  Su
sitio web incluso alardea de su "larga historia de militancia, creación de
memes y evangelismo".  ¿Quién dice que los gurúes espirituales no pueden tener
su propio capital de riesgo?


O’Reilly’s personal journey was not atypical for Silicon Valley. In a
2004 essay about his favorite books (published in *[Tim O’Reilly in a
Nutshell](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020080.do)*, brought
out by O’Reilly Media), O’Reilly confessed that, as a young man, he had
“[hopes of writing deep
books](http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/%20http://oreilly.com/tim/articles/favebooks_0705.html)
that would change the world.” O’Reilly credits a book of science fiction
documenting the struggles of a young girl against a corporate-dominated
plutocracy (*[Rissa
Kerguelen](http://www.amazon.com/Rissa-Kerguelen-Book-one-saga/dp/0399117911)*
by F. M. Busby) with helping him abandon his earlier dream of
revolutionary writing and enter the “fundamentally trivial business
\[of\] technical writing.” The book depicted entrepreneurship as a
“subversive force,” convincing O’Reilly that “in a world dominated by
large companies, it is the smaller companies that keep freedom alive,
with economics at least one of the battlegrounds.” This tendency to view
questions of freedom primarily through the lens of economic competition,
to focus on the producer and the entrepreneur at the expense of everyone
else, shaped O’Reilly’s thinking about technology.

La trayectoria personal de O'Reilly no fue atípica para _Sillicon Valley_.  En
un ensayo del 2004 sobre sus libros favoritos (publicado en _Tim O'Reilly para
principiantes_), confesaba que de joven tenía "esperanzas de escribir libros
profundos que cambiarían el mundo".  O'Reilly agrega que gracias a un libro de
ciencia ficción documentando las luchas de una joven contra una plutocracia
corporativa (Rissa Kerguelen de F. M. Busby) abandonó esos sueños tempranos de
escritura revolucionaria para entrar en el "negocio fundamentalmente trivial de
la escritura técnica".  El libro mostraba el emprendedorismo como una "fuerza
subversiva", que convenció a O'Reilly que "en un mundo dominado por las grandes
compañías, son las pequeñas las que mantienen viva la libertad, donde la
economía es al menos uno de los campos de batalla".  Esta tendencia a ver los
problemas de la libertad a través de la lente de la competencia económica,
poniendo el foco en el productor y el emprendedor a expensas de todas las
demás, configura el pensamiento de O'Reilly sobre la tecnología.

[![b22\_fisher1\_joe2.0\_308](The%20Meme%20Hustler%20-%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher1_joe2.png)](http://www.marksfisher.com/)However,
it’s not his politics that makes O’Reilly the most dangerous man in
Silicon Valley; a burgeoning enclave of Randian thought, it brims with
far nuttier cases. O’Reilly’s mastery of public relations, on the other
hand, is unrivaled and would put many of Washington’s top spin doctors
to shame. No one has done more to turn important debates about
technology—debates that used to be about rights, ethics, and
politics—into kumbaya celebrations of the entrepreneurial spirit while
making it seem as if the language of economics was, in fact, the only
reasonable way to talk about the subject. As O’Reilly discovered a long
time ago, memes are for losers; the real money is in epistemes.The
Randian undertones in O’Reilly’s thinking are hard to miss, even as he
flaunts his liberal credentials. “There’s a way in which the O’Reilly
brand essence is ultimately a story about the hacker as hero, the kid
who is playing with technology because he loves it, but one day falls
into a situation where he or she is called on to go forth and change the
world,” [he wrote in
2012](https://plus.google.com/+TimOReilly/posts/CLJmemTBMgf). But it’s
not just the hacker as hero that O’Reilly is so keen to celebrate. His
true hero is the hacker-cum-entrepreneur, someone who overcomes the
insurmountable obstacles erected by giant corporations and lazy
bureaucrats in order to fulfill the American Dream 2.0: start a company,
disrupt an industry, coin a buzzword. Hiding beneath this glossy veneer
of disruption-talk is the same old gospel of individualism, small
government, and market fundamentalism that we associate with Randian
characters. For Silicon Valley and its idols, innovation is the new
selfishness.

Sin embargo, no es la política lo que vuelve a O'Reilly el hombre más peligroso
de todo _Sillicon Valley_, quesiendo un enclave del pensamiento randiano,
rebosa de casos más locos.  La maestría de O'Reilly para las relaciones
públicas, por otro lado, no tiene rival y avergonzaría a muchos de los _spin
doctors_ más importantes de Washington.  Nadie ha hecho más por volver los
debates más importantes sobre la tecnología --debates que solían ser sobre
derechos, ética y política-- en celebraciones kumbaya sobre el espíritu
emprendedorista, mientras que el lenguaje económico se convertía en la única
forma razonable de hablar sobre el tema.  Como descubrió O'Reilly hace mucho
tiempo, el dinero está en las epistemes.  Los tonos randianos del pensamiento
de O'Reilly son difíciles de evitar, aun cuando ostente sus credenciales
progresistas.  "Existe una forma en que la esencia de la marca O'Reilly es en
última instancia una historia sobre la hacker como una heroína, la chica que
está jugando con tecnología porque le encanta, pero que un día cae en una
situación donde es llamada a salir y cambiar el mundo", escribía en 2012.  Pero
no solo se trata de la hacker como una heroína que O'Reilly no se cansa de
celebrar.  Su verdadera heroína es la hacker-devenida-emprendedora, alguien que
supera los innumerables obstáculos erigidos por corporaciones gigantes y
burócratas perezosos, para cumpir con el Sueño Americano 2.0:  empezar una
compañía, desbaratar una industria, acuñar una _buzzword_.  Escondido detrás de
toda este desbaratamiento de brillantina está el mismo viejo pregón
individualista, gobierno mínimo y fundamentalismo de mercado que asociamos con
los personajes randianos.  Para _Sillicon Valley_ y sus ídolos, la innovación
es el nuevo egoísmo.

<span class="dropcap">O</span>’Reilly got his start in business in 1978
when he launched a consulting firm that specialized in technical
writing. Six years later, it began retaining rights to some of the
manuals it was producing for individual clients and gradually branched
out into more mainstream publishing. By the mid-1990s, O’Reilly had
achieved some moderate success in Silicon Valley. He was well-off,
having found a bestseller in *The Whole Internet User’s Guide and
Catalog* and having sold the Global Network Navigator—possibly the first
Internet portal to feature paid banner advertising (“[the first
commercial website](http://oreilly.com/gnn/)” as O’Reilly describes it
today)—to AOL.

O'Reilly se inició en el negocio en el '78 al lanzar una consultora que se
especializaba en escritura técnica.  Seis años después, empezó a retener los
derechos de algunos de los manuales que estaba produciendo para sus clientes
individuales y gradualmente se abrió camino hacia la edición _mainstream_.
Para mediados de los '90, O'Reilly había alcanzado un éxito moderado en
_Sillicon Valley_.  Le iba bien, habiendo encontrado un _best-seller_ en _The
Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog_ [La guía completa del usuario de
Internet y catálogo] y vendido el _Global Network Navigator_ --posiblemente el
primer portal de Internet con publicidad paga ("el primer sitio web comercial"
como lo describe O'Reilly)-- a AOL.

It was the growing popularity of “open source software” that turned
O’Reilly into a national (and, at least in geek circles, international)
figure. “Open source software” was also the first major rebranding
exercise overseen by Team O’Reilly. This is where he tested all his
trademark discursive interventions: hosting a summit to define the
concept, penning provocative essays to refine it, producing a host of
books and events to popularize it, and cultivating a network of thinkers
to proselytize it.

Fue la popularidad creciente del "software de código abierto" lo que lo
convirtió en una figura nacional (y al menos en los círculos _geek_, también
internacional).  El "software de código abierto" fue también el primer gran
ejercicio de cambio de marca llevado a cabo por el Equipo O'Reilly.  Es donde
puso a prueba todas sus intervenciones discursivas que son su marca:  alojando
un encuentro para definir el concepto, escribiendo ensayos provocativos para
refinarlo, produciendo libros y eventos para popularizarlo y cultivando una red
de pensadores para hacerle proselitismo.

[![b22\_fisher2\_internetgod\_308](The%20Meme%20Hustler%20-%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher2_internetgod_308.png)](http://www.marksfisher.com/)Software
that ensured the aforementioned four rights was dubbed “free software.”
It was “free” thanks to its association with “freedom” rather than “free
beer”; there was no theoretical opposition to charging money for
building and maintaining such software. To provide legal cover, Stallman
invented an ingenious license that relied on copyright law to suspend
its own most draconian provisions—a legal trick that came to be known as
“copyleft.” GPL (short for “General Public License”) has become the most
famous and widely used of such “copyleft” licenses.It’s easy to forget
this today, but there was no such idea as open source software before
1998; the concept’s seeming contemporary coherence is the result of
clever manipulation and marketing. Open source software was born out of
an ideological cleavage between two groups that, at least before 1998,
had been traditionally lumped together. In one corner stood a group of
passionate and principled geeks, led by Richard Stallman of the Free
Software Foundation, preoccupied with ensuring that users had rights
with respect to their computer programs. Those rights weren’t many—users
should be able to run the program for any purpose, to study how it
works, to redistribute copies of it, and to release their improved
version (if there was one) to the public—but even this seemed
revolutionary compared to what one could do with most proprietary
software sold at the time.

El software que aseguraba los cuatro derechos antes mencionados se llamaba
"software libre".  Era "libre" por su asociación a la "libertad" antes que a la
"cerveza libre".  No había una oposición teórica a cobrar dinero por construir
o mantener ese software.  Para proveer cobertura legal, Stallman inventó una
licencia muy ingeniosa que usaba las leyes de _copyright_ para suspender sus
provisiones más draconianas --un truco legal que es conocido como _copyleft_.
La GPL (acrónimo de "General Public License" [Licencia Pública General]) se ha
convertido en la más famosa y utilizada de estas licencias _copyleft_.  Es
fácil olvidarse esto hoy en día, pero no había algo conocido como software de
código abierto antes de 1998.  La coherencia contemporánea aparente del
concepto es producto de la manipulación astuta y el _marketing_.  El software
de código abierto nació de la escisión ideológica entre dos grupos que, al
menos antes de 1998, habían estado tradicionalmente juntos.  En una esquina
estaba el grupo de _geeks_ apasionadas y con principios lideradas por Richard
Stallman de la _Free Software Foundation_, preocupadas por asegurar que las
usuarias tengan derechos con respecto a sus programas de computadoras.  Esos
derechos no eran muchos --las usuarias deben ser capaces de usar el programa
con cualquier propósito, estudiarlo, re-distribuir copias y publicar sus
propias versiones modificadas si las hubiese-- pero aun esto parecía
revolucionario en comparación a lo que se podía hacer con el software privativo
de ese momento.

From its very beginning in the early 1980s, Stallman’s movement aimed to
produce a free software alternative to proprietary operating systems
like Unix and Microsoft Windows and proprietary software like Microsoft
Office. Stallman’s may not have been the best software on offer, but
some sacrifice of technological efficiency was a price worth paying for
emancipation. Some discomfort might even be desirable, for [Stallman’s
goal](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html), as
he put it in his 1998 essay “Why ‘Free Software’ is Better Than ‘Open
Source,’” was to ask “people to think about things they might rather
ignore.”

Desde sus mismos comienzos en los '80, el movimiento de Stallman apuntaba a
producir alternativas de software libre a sistemas operativos privativos como
Unix y Microsoft Windows así como software privativo como Microsoft Office.  El
software de Stallman podría no haber sido el mejor, pero algún sacrificio en la
eficiencia técnica era un precio digno de pagar por la emancipación.  Alguna
incomodidad era incluso deseable, porque el objetivo de Stallman, como decía en
su ensayo de 1998 "Por qué el software libre es mejor que el código abierto",
era pedir que "la gente piense sobre cosas que de otra forma ignoraría".

> As O’Reilly discovered a long time ago, memes are for losers; the real
> money is in epistemes.

Underpinning Stallman’s project was a profound critique of the role that
patent law had come to play in stifling innovation and creativity.
Perhaps inadvertently, Stallman also made a prescient argument for
treating code, and technological infrastructure more broadly, as
something that ought to be subject to public scrutiny. He sought to open
up the very technological black boxes that corporations conspired to
keep shut. Had his efforts succeeded, we might already be living in a
world where the intricacies of software used for high-frequency trading
or biometric identification presented no major mysteries.

Lo que apuntalaba el proyecto de Stallman era una crítica profunda al rol de
las regulaciones de patentes que se habían convertido en retenes para la
innovación y la creatividad.  Tal vez sin darse cuenta, Stallman argumentaba
prescientemente sobre por qué el código, y más ampliamente la infraestructura
tecnológica, debía estar sometido al escrutinio público.  Buscaba abrir las
cajas negras tecnológicas que las corporaciones conspiraban por mantener
cerradas.  Si sus esfuerzos hubieran sido exitosos, podríamos estar viviendo en
un mundo donde las complejidades del software utilizado en la bolsa o la
identificación biométrica no presentaran mayores misterios.

Stallman is highly idiosyncratic, to put it mildly, and there are many geeks
who don’t share his agenda. Plenty of developers contributed to “free software”
projects for reasons that had nothing to do with politics. Some, like Linus
Torvalds, the Finnish creator of the much-celebrated Linux operating system,
did so for fun; some because they wanted to build more convenient software;
some because they wanted to learn new and much-demanded skills.

Stallman es bastante idiosincrático, para decirlo levemente, y muchas geeks no
comparten su agenda.  Muchas desarrolladoras contribuyen a proyectos de
software libre por razones que no tienen nada que ver con la política.
Algunas, como Linus Torvalds, el creador finlandés del celebrado sistema
operativo Linux, lo hacían por diversión.  Otras porque querían construir
software más conveniente.  Y otras porque querían aprender habilidades nuevas y
en demanda.

Once the corporate world began expressing interest in free software, many
nonpolitical geeks sensed a lucrative business opportunity. As technology
entrepreneur [Michael Tiemann put it in
1999](http://oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/tiemans.html), while
     Stallman’s manifesto “read like a socialist polemic . . . I saw something
     different. I saw a business plan in disguise.” Stallman’s rights-talk,
     however, risked alienating the corporate types. Stallman didn’t care about
     offending the suits, as his goal was to convince ordinary users to choose
     free software on ethical grounds, not to sell it to business types as a
     cheaper or more efficient alternative to proprietary software. After all,
     he was trying to launch a radical social movement, not a complacent
     business association.

Una vez que el mundo corporativo empezó a expresar interés por el software
libre, muchas geeks no políticas presintieron una oportunidad de negocios
lucrativa.  Como decía el emprendedor tecnológico Michael Tiemann en 1999,
mientras que el manifiesto de Stallman "se leía como una polémica socialista...
vi algo diferente.  Vi un plan de negocios disfrazado."  La militancia por los
derechos que hacía Stallman, sin embargo, ponía en riesgo el interés de la
gente corporativa.  A Stallman no le importaba ofender a la gente de traje,
porque su objetivo era convencer a las usuarias ordinarias para que elijan el
software libre por motivos éticos y no venderlo a los negociantes como una
alternativa más barata o eficiente al software privativo.  Después de todo,
estaba intentando lanzar un movimiento social radical, no una asociación de
negocios complaciente.

By early 1998 several business-minded members of the free software
community were ready to split from Stallman, so they masterminded a
coup, formed their own advocacy outlet—the Open Source Initiative—and
brought in O’Reilly to help them rebrand. The timing was right. Netscape
had just marked its capitulation to Microsoft in the so-called Browser
Wars and promised both that all future versions of Netscape Communicator
would be released free of charge and that its code would also be made
publicly available. A few months later, O’Reilly organized
a[much-publicized
summit](http://oreilly.com/oreilly/press/freeware.html), where a number
of handpicked loyalists—Silicon democracy in action!—voted for “open
source” as their preferred label. Stallman was not invited.

Para principios del '98 varios miembros de la comunidad del software libre con
mente de negocios estaban listos para separarse de Stallman, por lo que
planearon un golpe, formando su propio espacio de activismo --la _Open Source
Iniciative_ [Iniciativa por el Código Abierto]--, trayendo a O'Reilly para
ayudarles en el cambio de marca.  El tiempo era el correcto.  _Netscape_
acababa de rendirse ante Microsoft en las guerras entre navegadores y había
prometido que las próximas versiones de _Netscape Communicator_[^?] serían
gratuitas, a la vez que su código estaría disponible públicamente.  Algunos
meses después, O'Reilly organizaba un muy publicitado encuentro, donde algunos
de los lealistas escogidos --¡democracia de silicona en acción!-- votaron por
_open source_ [código abierto] como la marca preferida.  Stallman no estuvo
invitado.

[^?]: No es netscape navigator?

The label “open source” may have been new, but the ideas behind it had
been in the air for some time. In 1997, even before the coup, Eric
Raymond—a close associate of O’Reilly, a passionate libertarian, and the
founder of a group with the self-explanatory title “Geeks with
Guns”—delivered a brainy talk called “[The Cathedral and the
Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/),”
which foresaw the emergence of a new, radically collaborative way to
make software. (In 1999, O’Reilly turned it into a successful book.)
Emphasizing its highly distributed nature, Raymond captured the essence
of open source software in a big-paradigm kind of way that could
spellbind McKinsey consultants and leftist academics alike.

La marca _open source_ puede haber sido nueva, pero las ideas detrás de ella
habían circulado antes.  En 1997, aun antes del golpe, Eric Raymond --un
asociado cercano de O'Reilly, _libertarian_ apasionado y fundador del grupo con
nombre auto-explicativo _Geeks with Guns_ [Geeks con armas]-- daba una charla
muy intelectual llamada _La catedral y el bazar_, que preveía la emergencia una
forma nueva y radicalmente colaborativa de producir software.  (En 1999,
O'Reilly lo convirtió en un exitoso libro.)  Poniendo énfasis en su naturaleza
altamente distribuida, Raymond capturó la esencia del software de código
abierto en forma de un gran paradigma que podía atraer tanto a consultores de
McKinsey como a académicas de izquierda.

[![b22\_fisher3\_bssurvayer\_308](The%20Meme%20Hustler%20-%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher3_bssurvayer_308.png)](http://www.marksfisher.com/)Even
before the coup, O’Reilly occupied an ambiguous—and commercially
pivotal—place in the free software community. On the one hand, he
published manuals that helped to train new converts to the cause. On the
other hand, those manuals were pricey. They were also of excellent
quality, which, as Stallman once complained, discouraged the community
from producing inexpensive alternatives. Ultimately, however, the
disagreement between Stallman and O’Reilly—and the latter soon became
the most visible cheerleader of the open source paradigm—probably had to
do with their very different roles and aspirations. Stallman the social
reformer could wait for decades until his ethical argument for free
software prevailed in the public debate. O’Reilly the savvy businessman
had a much shorter timeline: a quick embrace of open source software by
the business community guaranteed steady demand for O’Reilly books and
events, especially at a time when some analysts were beginning to
worry—and for good reason, as it turned out—that the tech industry was
about to collapse.In those early days, the messaging around open source
occasionally bordered on propaganda. [As Raymond himself put it in
1999](http://oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/raymond2.html), “what

Aun antes del golpe, O'Reilly ocupaba un lugar ambiguo y comercialmente
esencial en la comunidad del software libre.  Por un lado, publicaba manuales
que ayudaban a entrenar a las nuevas conversas a la causa.  Por otro, esos
manuales eran caros.  También eran de excelente calidad, lo que, como se
quejaba Stallman, desalentaban a la comunidad de producir alternativas más
baratas.  En última instancia, sin embargo, el desacuerdo entre Stallman y
O'Reilly --siendo que este último se convertiría muy pronto en el animador más
visible del paradigma del código abierto-- probablemente haya tenido que ver
con sus muy diferentes roles y aspiraciones.  Stallman como reformista social
podía esperar décadas hasta que sus argumentos éticos en favor del software
libre prevaliesen en el debate público.  O'Reilly el hombre de negocios
inteligente tenía un tiempo más corto:  la adopción rápida del software de
código abierto por la comunidad empresarial garantizada una demanda estable por
los libros y eventosde O'Reilly, especialmente en un momento donde algunos
analistas empezaban a preocuparse --y con buenas razones, como resultaría más
tarde-- porque la industria tecnológica esté al borde del colapso.  En aquellos
días, la mensajería acerca del código abierto bordeaba ocasionalmente con la
propaganda.  Como decía Raymond en 1999

we needed to mount was in effect a *marketing campaign*,” one that
“would require marketing techniques (spin, image-building, and
re-branding) to make it work.” This budding movement prided itself on
not wanting to talk about the ends it was pursuing; except for improving
efficiency and decreasing costs, those were left very much undefined.
Instead, it put all the emphasis on *how* it was pursuing those ends—in
an extremely decentralized manner, using Internet platforms, with little
central coordination. In contrast to free software, then, open source
had no obvious moral component. [According to
Raymond](http://www.opendemocracy.net/media-copyrightlaw/article_246.jsp),
“open source is not particularly a moral or a legal issue. It’s an
engineering issue. I advocate open source, because . . . it leads to
better engineering results and better economic results.” O’Reilly
concurred. “I don’t think it’s a religious issue. It’s really about how
do we actually encourage and spark innovation,” he [announced a decade
later](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10264471-16.html). While free
software was meant to force developers to lose sleep over ethical
dilemmas, open source software was meant to end their insomnia.

"lo que necesitábamos montar era efectivamente una campaña de marketing" que
"requeriría poner en juego técnicas de marketing (_spin_, construcción de
imagen y cambio de marca) para funcionar".  Este movimiento en ciernes se
enorgullecía en no querer hablar sobre los objetivos que perseguía.  A
excepción de la mejora en la eficiencia y la reducción de costos, todo lo demás
estaba bastante indefinido.

The coup succeeded. Stallman’s project was marginalized. But O’Reilly
and his acolytes didn’t win with better arguments; they won with better
PR. To make his narrative about open source software credible to a
public increasingly fascinated by the Internet, O’Reilly produced a
highly particularized account of the Internet that subsequently took on
a life of its own. In just a few years, that narrative became the
standard way to talk about Internet history, giving it the kind of neat
intellectual coherence that it never actually had. A decade after
producing a singular vision of the Internet to justify his ideas about
the supremacy of the open source paradigm, O’Reilly is close to pulling
a similar trick on how we talk about government reform.

El golpe tuvo exito. El proyecto de Stallman fue marginalizado. Pero O'Reilly
y sus discípulos no ganaron por tener mejores argumentos; ganaron por tener mejores
relaciones publicas. Para hacer su narrativa sobre _open source_  creible
a un publico con una creciente fascinacion por internet, O'Reilly produjo 


<span class="dropcap">T</span>o understand how O’Reilly’s idea of the
Internet helped legitimize the open source paradigm, it’s important to
remember that much of Stallman’s efforts centered on software licenses.
O’Reilly’s bet was that as software migrated from desktops to
servers—what, in another fit of buzzwordophilia, we later called the
“cloud”—licenses would cease to matter. Since no code changed hands when
we used Google or Amazon, it was counterproductive to fixate on
licenses. “Let’s stop thinking about licenses for a little bit. Let’s
stop thinking that that’s the core of what matters about open source,”
O’Reilly urged in an[interview with
*InfoWorld*](http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/tim-oreilly-software-licenses-dont-work-261)
in 2003.

So what did matter about open source? Not “freedom”—at least not in
Stallman’s sense of the word. O’Reilly cared for only one type of
freedom: the freedom of developers to distribute software on whatever
terms they fancied. This was the freedom of the producer, the Randian
entrepreneur, who must be left to innovate, undisturbed by laws and
ethics. The most important freedom, as O’Reilly put it in a[2001
exchange with
Stallman](http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/08/15/oreilly_response.html),
is that which protects “my choice as a creator to give, or not to give,
the fruits of my work to you, as a ‘user’ of that work, and for you, as
a user, to accept or reject the terms I place on that gift.”

This stood in stark contrast to Stallman’s plan of curtailing—by appeals
to ethics and, one day, perhaps, law—the freedom of developers in order
to promote the freedom of users. O’Reilly [opposed this
agenda](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/900): “I completely support
the right of Richard \[Stallman\] or any individual author to make his
or her work available under the terms of the GPL; I balk when they say
that others who do not do so are doing something wrong.” The right thing
to do, according to O’Reilly, was to leave developers alone. “I am
willing to accept any argument that says that there are advantages and
disadvantages to any particular licensing method. . . . My moral
position is that people should be free to find out what works for them,”
[he wrote in 2001](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/900). That “what
works” for developers might eventually hurt everyone else—which was
essentially Stallman’s argument—did not bother O’Reilly. For all his
economistic outlook, he was not one to talk externalities.

[![b22\_fisher4\_crush\_308](The%20Meme%20Hustler%20-%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher4_crush_308.png)](http://www.marksfisher.com/)That
such an argument could be mounted reveals just how much political
baggage was smuggled into policy debates once “open source software”
replaced “free software” as the idiom of choice. Governments are
constantly pushed to do things someone in the private sector may not
like; why should the software industry be special? Promoting
accountability or improving network security might indeed disrupt
someone’s business model—but so what? Once a term like “open source”
entered our vocabulary, one could recast the whole public policy
calculus in very different terms, so that instead of discussing the
public interest, we are discussing the interests of individual software
developers, while claiming that this is a discussion about “innovation”
and “progress,” not “accountability” or “security.”According to this
Randian interpretation of open source, the goal of regulation and public
advocacy should be to ensure that absolutely nothing—no laws or petty
moral considerations—stood in the way of the open source revolution. Any
move to subject the fruits of developers’ labor to public regulation,
even if its goal was to promote a greater uptake of open source
software, must be opposed, since it would taint the reputation of open
source as technologically and economically superior to proprietary
software. Occasionally this stance led to paradoxes, as, for example,
during a [heated 2002
debate](http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/%20http://news.slashdot.org/story/02/08/16/1621244/tim-oreilly-bashes-open-source-efforts-in-govt)
on whether governments should be required to ditch Microsoft and switch
to open source software. O’Reilly expressed his vehement opposition to
such calls. “No one should be forced to choose open source, any more
than they should be forced to choose proprietary software. And any
victory for open source achieved through deprivation of the user’s right
to choose would indeed be a betrayal of the principles that free
software and open source have stood for,” O’Reilly wrote in a [widely
discussed blog post](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1840).

To weaken Stallman’s position, O’Reilly had to show that the free
software movement was fighting a pointless, stupid war: the advent of
the Internet made Stallman’s obsession with licenses obsolete. There was
a fair amount of semantic manipulation at play here. For Stallman,
licenses were never an end in themselves; they mattered only as much as
they codified a set of practices deriving from his vision of a
technologically mediated good life. Licenses, in other words, were just
the means to enable the one and only end that mattered to free software
advocates: freedom. A different set of technological practices—e.g., the
move from desktop-run software to the cloud—could have easily
accommodated a different means of ensuring that freedom.

In fact, Stallman’s philosophy, however rudimentary, had all the right
conceptual tools to let us think about the desirability of moving
everything to the cloud. The ensuing assault on privacy, the
centralization of data in the hands of just a handful of companies, the
growing accessibility of user data to law enforcement agencies who don’t
even bother getting a warrant: all those consequences of cloud computing
could have been predicted and analyzed, even if fighting those
consequences would have required tools other than licenses. O’Reilly’s
PR genius lay in having almost everyone confuse the means and the ends
of the free software movement. Since licenses were obsolete, the
argument went, software developers could pretty much disregard the ends
of Stallman’s project (i.e., its focus on user rights and freedoms) as
well. Many developers did stop thinking about licenses, and, having
stopped thinking about licenses, they also stopped thinking about
broader moral issues that would have remained central to the debates had
“open source” not displaced “free software” as the paradigm du jour.
Sure, there were exceptions—like the highly political and legalistic
community that worked on Debian, yet another operating system—but they
were the exceptions that proved the rule.

To maximize the appeal and legitimacy of this new paradigm, O’Reilly had
to establish that open source both predated free software and was well
on its way to conquering the world—that it had a rich history and a rich
future. The first objective he accomplished, in part, by exploiting the
ambiguities of the term “open”; the second by framing debate about the
Internet around its complex causal connections to open source software.

[![b22\_fisher5\_globalbrain\_308](The%20Meme%20Hustler%20-%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher5_globalbrain_308.png)](http://www.marksfisher.com/)“Open”
allowed O’Reilly to build the largest possible tent for the movement.
The language of economics was less alienating than Stallman’s language
of ethics; “openness” was the kind of multipurpose term that allowed one
to look political while advancing an agenda that had very little to do
with politics. [As O’Reilly put it in
2010](http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/04/handicapping-internet-platform-wars.html),
“the art of promoting openness is not to make it a moral crusade, but
rather to highlight the competitive advantages of openness.” Replace
“openness” with any other loaded term—say “human rights”—in this
sentence, and it becomes clear that this quest for “openness” was
politically toothless from the very outset. What, after all, if your
interlocutor doesn’t give a damn about competitive advantages?The term
“open source” was not invented by O’Reilly. Christine Peterson, the
cofounder of Foresight Institute (a nanotechnology think tank), coined
it in a February 1998 brainstorm session convened to react to Netscape’s
release of Navigator’s source code. Few words in the English language
pack as much ambiguity and sexiness as “open.” And after O’Reilly’s
bombastic interventions—“Open allows experimentation. Open encourages
competition. Open wins,” [he once
proclaimed](http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/22/kindle-oreilly-ebooks-technology-breakthroughs_oreilly.html)
in an essay—its luster has only intensified. Profiting from the term’s
ambiguity, O’Reilly and his collaborators likened the “openness” of open
source software to the “openness” of the academic enterprise, markets,
and free speech. “Open” thus could mean virtually anything, from “open
to intellectual exchange” ([O’Reilly in
1999](http://web.archive.org/web/20000119094723/http://sunworld.com/sunworldonline/swol-01-1999/swol-01-regex-2.html):
“Once you start thinking of computer source code as a human language,
you see open source as a variety of ‘free speech’”) to “open to
competition” ([O’Reilly in
2000](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4179): “For me, ‘open source’ in
the broader sense means any system in which open access to code lowers
the barriers to entry into the market”).

Unsurprisingly, the availability of source code for universal
examination soon became the one and only benchmark of openness. What the
code did was of little importance—the market knows best!—as long as
anyone could check it for bugs. The new paradigm was presented as
something that went beyond ideology and could attract corporate
executives without losing its appeal to the hacker crowd. “The
implication of \[the open source\] label is that we intend to convince
the corporate world to adopt our way for economic, self-interested,
non-ideological reasons,” [Eric Raymond noted in
1998](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2918). What Raymond and
O’Reilly failed to grasp, or decided to overlook, is that their effort
to present open source as non-ideological was underpinned by a powerful
ideology of its own—an ideology that worshiped innovation and efficiency
at the expense of everything else.

It took a lot of creative work to make the new paradigm stick. One
common tactic was to present open source as having a much longer history
that even predates 1998. Thus, writing shortly after O’Reilly’s historic
open source summit, [Raymond noted
that](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2918) “the summit was hosted
by O’Reilly & Associates, a company that has been symbiotic with the
Open Source movement for many years.” That the term “open source” was
just a few months old by the time Raymond wrote this didn’t much matter.
History was something that clever PR could easily fix. “As we thought
about it, we said, gosh, this is also a great PR opportunity—we’re a
company that has learned to work the PR angles on things,” [O’Reilly
said in
1999](http://books.google.com/books?id=kIU1scm4w6QC&lpg=PA169&ots=XymvERLdeY&dq=%22So%20part%20of%20the%20agenda%20for%20the%20summit%20was%20hey%2C%20just%20to%20meet%20and%20find%20out%20what%20we%20had%20in%20common.%22&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q&f=false).
“So part of the agenda for the summit was hey, just to meet and find out
what we had in common. And the second agenda was really to make a
statement of some kind \[that\] this was a movement, that all these
different programs had something in common.”

What they had in common was disdain for Stallman’s moralizing—barely
enough to justify their revolutionary agenda, especially among the
hacker crowds who were traditionally suspicious of anyone eager to suck
up to the big corporations that aspired to dominate the open source
scene.

By linking this new movement to both the history of the Internet and its
future, O’Reilly avoided most of those concerns. One didn’t have to
choose open source, because the choice had already been made. As long as
everyone believed that “open source” implied “the Internet” and that
“the Internet” implied “open source,” it would be very hard to resist
the new paradigm. As O’Reilly—always the PR man—[wrote in a 2004
essay](http://oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/articles/architecture_of_participation.html),
“It has always baffled and disappointed me that the open source
community has not claimed the web as one of its greatest success
stories. . . . That’s a PR failure!” To make up for that failure,
O’Reilly had to establish some causal relationship between the two—the
details could be worked out later on.

> “Openness” was the kind of multipurpose term that allowed one to look
> political while advancing an agenda that had very little to do with
> politics.

“I think there’s a paradigm shift going on right now, and it’s really
around both open source and the Internet, and it’s not entirely clear
which one is the driver and which one is the passenger, but at least
they are fellow travellers,” he announced in his [*InfoWorld*
interview](http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/tim-oreilly-software-licenses-dont-work-261).
Compared to the kind of universal excitement generated by the Internet,
Stallman’s license-talk was about as exciting as performing Mahler at a
Jay-Z concert. [As O’Reilly himself
acknowledged](http://www.oreillynet.com/network/2000/06/09/java_keynote.html),
his “emphasis in talking about open source has never been on the details
of licenses, but on open source as a foundation and expression of the
Internet.” When something is touted as both a foundation and an
expression of something else, the underlying logic could probably
benefit from more rigor.

Telling a coherent story about open source required finding some inner
logic to the history of the Internet. O’Reilly was up to the task. “If
you believe me that open source is about Internet-enabled collaboration,
rather than just about a particular style of software license,” [he said
in 2000](http://oreilly.com/tim/articles/paradigmshift_0504.html),
“you’ll see the threads that tie together not just traditional open
source projects, but also collaborative ‘computing grid’ projects like
SETIAtHome, user reviews on Amazon.com, technologies like collaborative
filtering, new ideas about marketing such as those expressed in *The
Cluetrain Manifesto*, weblogs, and the way that Internet message boards
can now move the stock market.” In other words, everything on the
Internet was connected to everything else—via open source.

The way O’Reilly saw it, many of the key developments of Internet
culture were already driven by what he called “open source behavior,”
even if such behavior was not codified in licenses. For example, the
fact that one could view the source code of a webpage right in one’s
browser has little to do with open source software, but it was part of
the same “openness” spirit that O’Reilly saw at work in the Internet. No
moralizing (let alone legislation) was needed; the Internet already
lived and breathed open source. What O’Reilly didn’t say is that, of
course, it didn’t have to be this way forever. Now that apps might be
displacing the browser, the openness once taken for granted is no more—a
contingency that licenses and morals could have easily prevented.
Openness as a happenstance of market conditions is a very different
beast from openness as a guaranteed product of laws.

One of the key consequences of linking the Internet to the world of open
source was to establish the primacy of the Internet as the new,
reinvented desktop—as the greatest, and perhaps ultimate, platform—for
hosting third-party services and applications. This is where the
now-forgotten language of “freedom” made a comeback, since it was
important to ensure that O’Reilly’s heroic Randian hacker-entrepreneurs
were allowed to roam freely. Soon this “freedom to innovate” morphed
into “Internet freedom,” so that what we are trying to preserve is the
innovative potential of the platform, regardless of the effects on
individual users.

Stallman had on offer something far more precise and revolutionary: a
way to think about the freedoms of individual users in specific
contexts, as if the well-being of the mega-platform were of secondary
importance. But that vision never came to pass. Instead, public advocacy
efforts were channeled into preserving an abstract and reified
configuration of digital technologies—“the Internet”—so that Silicon
Valley could continue making money by hoovering up our private data.

Lumping everything under the label of “Internet freedom” did have some
advantages for those genuinely interested in promoting rights such as
freedom of expression—the religious fervor that many users feel about
the Internet has helped catalyze a lot of activist campaigns—but, by and
large, the concept also blunted our analytical ability to balance rights
against each other. Forced to choose between preserving the freedom of
the Internet or that of its users, we were supposed to choose the
former—because “the Internet” stood for progress and enlightenment.

<span class="dropcap">I</span>n the late 1990s, O’Reilly began
celebrating “infoware” as the[next big
thing](http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/tim.html) after
“hardware” and “software.” His premise was that Internet companies such
as Yahoo and E-Trade were not in the software business but in the
infoware business. Their functionality was pretty basic—they allowed
customers to make purchases or look up something on a map—so their value
proposition lay in the information they delivered, not in the software
function they executed. And all those fancy Internet services that made
infoware possible were patched together with open source software. By
showing that infoware was the future and that open source software was
its essential component, O’Reilly sought to reassure those who hadn’t
joined the movement of their pivotal role in the future of computing, if
not all human progress.

The “infoware” buzzword didn’t catch on, so O’Reilly turned to the work
of Douglas Engelbart, the idiosyncratic inventor who gave us the
computer mouse and hypertext, to argue that the Internet could help
humanity augment its “collective intelligence” and that, once again,
open source software was crucial to this endeavor. Now it was all about
Amazon learning from its customers and Google learning from the sites in
its index. The idea of the Internet as both a repository and incubator
of “collective intelligence” was very appealing to Silicon Valley, not
least because it tapped into the New Age rhetoric of the 1970s, but the
dotcom crash briefly forced O’Reilly to put his philosophizing on hold.
When the tech bubble burst, the demand for manuals and conferences—the
bulk of O’Reilly’s business—shrank, while he also had to deal with some
unpleasant litigation concerning his office headquarters in Sebastopol,
California. He fired a quarter of his staff, and things looked pretty
dire.

[![b22\_fisher6\_godsofinternet\_308](The%20Meme%20Hustler%20-%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher6_godsofinternet_308.png)](http://www.marksfisher.com/)Thus,
a high-profile conference was born, aimed explicitly at helping VIPs in
the Valley “see the shape of the future,” to be followed by many others.
O’Reilly soon [expanded on the idea of Web
2.0](http://gossgrove.com/sites/default/files/web2009_websquared-whitepaper.pdf)
in an essay that he coauthored with writer and entrepreneur John
Battelle. O’Reilly couldn’t improve on a concept as sexy as “collective
intelligence,” so he kept it as the defining feature of this new
phenomenon. What set Web 2.0 apart from Web 1.0, O’Reilly claimed, was
the simple fact that those firms that didn’t embrace it went bust. All
Silicon Valley companies should heed the lesson of those few who
survived: they must find a way to harness collective intelligence and
make it part of their business model. They must become true carriers of
the Web 2.0 spirit.Then, in 2004, O’Reilly and his business partner Dale
Dougherty hit on the idea of “Web 2.0.” What did “2.0” mean, exactly?
There was some theoretical ambition to this label—more about that later
on—but the primary goal was to show that the 2001 market crash did not
mean the end of the web and that it was time to put the crash behind us
and start learning from those who survived. Given how much rhetorical
capital had been spent on linking the idea of the web with that of open
source, the end of the web would also mean the end of so many other
concepts. Tactically, “Web 2.0” could also be much bigger than “open
source”; it was the kind of sexy umbrella term that could allow O’Reilly
to branch out from boring and highly technical subjects to
pulse-quickening futurology. “We normally have lots of technical talks
focusing on how to use new software, building our conferences for the
hackers who are inventing the future, and the early adopters who are
taking their work to the next stage,” O’Reilly wrote in a [blog
post](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5466) announcing his very first
Web 2.0 conference. “In contrast, Web 2.0 is our first ‘executive
conference’—a conference aimed at business people, with the focus on the
big picture.”

O’Reilly’s explanation of the crash is curious. First of all, some tech
companies that did go under (Global Crossing comes to mind) couldn’t
harness collective intelligence, as they were in the telecommunications
business. Most memorable dotcom failures—cases like Pets.com—went under
because they were driven by foolish business models and overly exuberant
investors. (Pets.com would have made an even worse proposition if it had
followed O’Reilly’s playbook and become a Web 2.0 company.) Furthermore,
companies that didn’t follow the Web 2.0 mantra—like Barnes & Noble,
which O’Reilly singled out as a company that, unlike Amazon, wasn’t
learning from collective intelligence—didn’t go under at all.

By 2007, O’Reilly [readily
admitted](http://radar.oreilly.com/2007/10/todays-web-30-nonsense-blogsto.html)
that “Web 2.0 was a pretty crappy name for what’s happening.” Back in
2004, however, he seemed pretty serious, promoting this concept left and
right. The label caught on; like “open source,” it was ambiguous and
capacious enough to allow many alternative uses and interpretations.
O’Reilly’s partners in organizing the conference duly trademarked the
term “Web 2.0,” but this news wasn’t well received by their fellow
travellers (a similar effort to trademark “open source” by the Open
Source Initiative failed). Once “Web 2.0” was established as a term of
cultural reference, O’Reilly could venture outside Silicon Valley and
establish its relevance to other industries. Much as “open source
software” gave rise to “open source politics” and “open source science,”
so did “Web 2.0” expand its terminological empire. O’Reilly eventually
stuck a 2.0 label on anything that suited his business plan, running
events with titles like “Gov 2.0” and “Where 2.0.” Today, as everyone
buys into the 2.0 paradigm, O’Reilly is quietly dropping it. Last year
his “Where 2.0” conference on geolocation was rebranded as just “Where.”
The exceptional has become the new normal.

Sorting through the six thousand or so academic papers that cite
O’Reilly’s essay on Web 2.0 is no easy feat. It seems that anyone who
wanted to claim that a revolution was under way in their own field did
so simply by invoking the idea of Web 2.0 in their work: [Development

What unites most of these papers is a shared background assumption that,
thanks to the coming of Web 2.0, we are living through unique historical
circumstances. Except that there was no coming of Web 2.0—it was just a
way to sell a technology conference to a public badly burned by the
dotcom crash. Why anyone dealing with stress management or Wittgenstein
would be moved by the logistics of conference organizing is a mystery.

> O’Reilly stuck a 2.0 label on anything that suited his business plan.

O’Reilly himself pioneered this 2.0-ification of public discourse,
aggressively reinterpreting trends that had been happening for decades
through the prism of Internet history—a move that presented all those
trends as just a logical consequence of the Web 2.0 revolution. Take
[O’Reilly’s
musings](http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/09/why-dell-dot-com-is-more-enterprise.html)
on “Enterprise 2.0.” What is it, exactly? Well, it’s the same old
enterprise—for all we know, it might be making widgets—but now it has
learned something from Google and Amazon and found a way to harness
“collective intelligence.” For O’Reilly, Walmart is a quintessential
Enterprise 2.0 company simply because it tracks what its customers are
buying in real time.

That this is a rather standard practice—known under the boring title of
“just-in-time delivery”—predating both Google and Amazon didn’t register
with O’Reilly. In a Web 2.0 world, all those older concepts didn’t
matter or even exist; everything was driven by the forces of open source
and the Internet. A revolution was in the making!

This was a typical consequence of relying on Web 2.0 as the guiding
metaphor of the age: in the case of Enterprise 2.0, a trend that had
little connection to the Internet got reinscribed in the Internet frame,
as if attaching the label of 2.0 was all that was needed to establish
the logical parallels between the worlds of retail and search. This
tendency to redescribe reality in terms of Internet culture, regardless
of how spurious and tenuous the connection might be, is a fine example
of what I call “Internet-centrism.”

And soon Web 2.0 became the preferred way to explain any changes that
were happening in Silicon Valley and far beyond it. Most technology
analysts simply borrowed the label to explain whatever needed
explaining, taking its utility and objectivity for granted. “Open
source” gave us the “the Internet,” “the Internet” gave us “Web 2.0,”
“Web 2.0” gave us “Enterprise 2.0”: in this version of history, Tim
O’Reilly is more important than the European Union. Everything needed to
be rethought and redone: enterprises, governments, health care, finance,
factory production. For O’Reilly, there were few problems that could not
be [solved with Web 2.0](http://www.web2summit.com/web2008): “Our world
is fraught with problems . . . from roiling financial markets to global
warming, failing healthcare systems to intractable religious wars . . .
many of our most complex systems are reaching their limits. It strikes
us that the Web might teach us new ways to address these limits.” Web
2.0 was a source of didactic wisdom, and O’Reilly had the right tools to
interpret what it wanted to tell us—in each and every context, be it
financial markets or global warming. All those contexts belonged to the
Internet now. Internet-centrism won.

<span class="dropcap">I</span>n his 1976 book [*Crazy Talk, Stupid
Talk*](http://www.amazon.com/Crazy-Talk-Stupid-Defeat-Ourselves/dp/0385281781),
Neil Postman pointed to a certain linguistic imperialism that propels
crazy talk. For Postman, each human activity—religion, law, marriage,
commerce—represents a distinct “semantic environment” with its own tone,
purpose, and structure. Stupid talk is relatively harmless; it presents
no threat to its semantic environment and doesn’t cross into other ones.
Since it mostly consists of falsehoods and opinions “given by one
fallible human being about the remarks of another fallible human being,”
it can be easily corrected with facts. For example, to say that Tehran
is the capital of Iraq is stupid talk. Crazy talk, in contrast,
challenges a semantic environment, as it “establishes different purposes
and assumptions from those we normally accept.” To argue, as some Nazis
did, that the German soldiers ended up far more traumatized than their
victims is crazy talk.

For Postman, one of the main tasks of language is to codify and preserve
distinctions among different semantic environments. As he put it, “When
language becomes undifferentiated, human situations disintegrate:
Science becomes indistinguishable from religion, which becomes
indistinguishable from commerce, which becomes indistinguishable from
law, and so on. If each of them serves the same function, then none of
them serves any function. When such a process is occurring, an
appropriate word for it is *pollution.*” Some words—like “law”—are
particularly susceptible to crazy talk, as they mean so many different
things: from scientific “laws” to moral “laws” to “laws” of the market
to administrative “laws,” the same word captures many different social
relations. “Open,” “networks,” and “information” function much like
“law” in our own Internet discourse today.

Postman’s thinking on the inner workings of language was heavily
influenced by the work of [Alfred
Korzybski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski), a Polish
count now remembered—if at all—for his 1933 book [*Science and
Sanity*](http://www.amazon.com/Science-Sanity-Introduction-Non-Aristotelian-Semantics/dp/0937298018).
Korzybski founded a movement called general semantics. While it has
inspired many weird and dangerous followers—Scientology’s L. Ron Hubbard
claimed to have been a fan—it also earned the support of many serious
thinkers, from cyberneticians like Anatol Rapoport to philosophers like
Gaston Bachelard. For Korzybski, the world has a relational structure
that is always in flux; like Heraclitus, who argued that everything
flows, Korzybski believed that an object A at time x1 is not the same
object as object A at time x2 (he actually recommended indexing every
term we use with a relevant numerical in order to distinguish “science
1933” from “science 2013”). Our language could never properly account
for the highly fluid and relational structure of our reality—or as he
put it in his most famous aphorism, “the map is not the territory.”

Korzybski argued that we relate to our environments through the process
of “abstracting,” whereby our neurological limitations always produce an
incomplete and very selective summary of the world around us. There was
nothing harmful in this per se—Korzybski simply wanted to make people
aware of the highly selective nature of abstracting and give us the
tools to detect it in our everyday conversations. He wanted to
artificially induce what he called a “neurological delay” so that we
could gain more awareness of what we were doing in response to verbal
and nonverbal stimuli, understand what features of reality have been
omitted, and react appropriately.

To that end, Korzybski developed a number of mental tools meant to
reveal all the abstracting around us; he patented the most famous of
those—the “structural differential”—in the 1920s. He also encouraged his
followers to start using “etc.” at the end of their statements as a way
of making them aware of their inherent inability to say everything about
a given subject and to promote what he called the “consciousness of
abstraction.”

There was way too much craziness and bad science in Korzybski’s theories
for him to be treated as a serious thinker, but his basic question—as
Postman put it, “What are the characteristics of language which lead
people into making false evaluations of the world around them?”—still
remains relevant today.

Tim O’Reilly is, perhaps, the most high-profile follower of Korzybski’s
theories today. O’Reilly was introduced to Korzybski’s thought as a
teenager while working with a strange man called George Simon in the
midst of California’s counterculture of the early 1970s. O’Reilly and
Simon were coteaching workshops at the Esalen Institute—then a hotbed of
the “human potential movement” that sought to tap the hidden potential
of its followers and increase their happiness. Bridging Korzybski’s
philosophy with Sri Aurobindo’s integral yoga, Simon had an immense
influence on the young O’Reilly. Simon’s rereading of general semantics,
[noted O’Reilly in
2004](http://oreilly.com/tim/articles/favebooks_0705.html), “gave me a
grounding in how to see people, and to acknowledge what I saw, that is
the bedrock of my personal philosophy to this day.” (In 1976 the
twenty-two-year-old O’Reilly edited and [published
notebooks](http://www.amazon.com/Notebooks-1965-1973-George-Simon/dp/B0006XM7K2/)
by Simon after the latter died in an accident; even by the highly
demanding standards of the 1970s, those notebooks look outright crazy.)

O’Reilly openly acknowledges his debt to Korzybski, listing *Science and
Sanity* among [his favorite
books](http://oreilly.com/tim/articles/favebooks_0705.html) and even
showing [visualizations of the structural
differential](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir_7NJGhvsM) in his
presentations. It would be a mistake to think that O’Reilly’s linguistic
interventions—from “open source” to “Web 2.0”—are random or spontaneous.
There is a philosophy to them: a philosophy of knowledge and language
inspired by Korzybski. However, O’Reilly deploys Korzybski in much the
same way that the advertising industry deploys the latest findings in
neuroscience: the goal is not to increase awareness, but to manipulate.
If general semanticists aimed to reveal the underlying emptiness of many
concepts that pollute the public debate, O’Reilly is applying some of
Korzybski’s language insights to practice some pollution of his own.

O’Reilly, of course, sees his role differently, claiming that all he
wants is to make us aware of what earlier commentators may have
overlooked. “A metaphor is just that: a way of framing the issues such
that people can see something they might otherwise miss,” [he wrote in
response](http://blogs.gartner.com/andrea_dimaio/2009/09/08/why-government-is-not-a-platform/)
to a critic who accused him of linguistic incontinence. But Korzybski’s
point, if fully absorbed, is that a metaphor is primarily a way of
framing issues such that we *don’t* see something we might otherwise
see.

In public, O’Reilly modestly presents himself as someone who just
happens to excel at detecting the “faint signals” of emerging trends. He
does so by monitoring a group of überinnovators that he dubs the “alpha
geeks.” “The ‘alpha geeks’ show us where technology wants to go. Smart
companies follow and support their ingenuity rather than trying to
suppress it,” [O’Reilly writes](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3123).
His own function is that of an intermediary—someone who ensures that the
alpha geeks are heard by the [right
executives](http://www.oreillynet.com/network/2002/04/09/future.html):
“The alpha geeks are often a few years ahead of their time. . . . What
we do at O’Reilly is watch these folks, learn from them, and try to
spread the word by writing down (or helping them write down) what
they’ve learned and then publishing it in books or online.”

The name of his company’s blog—*O’Reilly Radar*—is meant to position him
as an independent intellectual who is simply ahead of his peers in
grasping the obvious. Some regular contributors to the *Radar* blog have
titles like “[correspondents](http://radar.oreilly.com/alexh),” giving
the whole operation a veneer of objectivity and disinterestedness, with
O’Reilly merely a commentator knowledgeable enough to provide some
context to busy Silicon Valley types. An [Edwin Schlossberg
quotation](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/2982) he really likes—“the
skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can
think”—is cited to explain his willingness to enter so many seemingly
unrelated fields. As Web 2.0 becomes central to everything, O’Reilly—the
world’s biggest exporter of crazy talk—is on a mission to provide the
appropriate “context” to every field.

In a fascinating essay published in 2000, O’Reilly sheds some light on
his modus operandi. The thinker who emerges there is very much at odds
with the spirit of objectivity that O’Reilly seeks to cultivate in
public. That essay, in fact, is a revealing ode to what O’Reilly dubs
“[meme-engineering](http://www.openp2p.com/lpt/a/495)”: “Just as gene
engineering allows us to artificially shape genes, meme-engineering lets
us organize and shape ideas so that they can be transmitted more
effectively, and have the desired effect once they are transmitted.” In
a move worthy of Frank Luntz, O’Reilly meme-engineers a nice
euphemism—“meme-engineering”—to describe what has previously been known
as “propaganda.”

The essay’s putative goal is to show how one can meme-engineer a new
meaning for “peer-to-peer” technologies—traditionally associated with
piracy—and make them appear friendly and not at all threatening to the
entertainment industry. Leading by example, O’Reilly invokes his success
in rebranding “free software” as “open source.” The key to success, he
notes, was to “put a completely different spin on what formerly might
have been considered the ‘same space.’” To make that happen, O’Reilly
and his acolytes “changed the canonical list of projects that we wanted
to hold up as exemplars of the movement,” while also articulating what
broader goals the projects on the new list served. He then proceeds to
rehash the already familiar narrative: O’Reilly put the Internet at the
center of everything, linking some “free software” projects like Apache
or Perl to successful Internet start-ups and services. As a result, the
movement’s goal was no longer to produce a completely free, independent,
and fully functional operating system but to worship at the altar of the
Internet gods.

Another apt example of O’Reilly’s meme-engineering is his attempt to
establish a strong intellectual link between the development of Unix—a
proprietary operating system that Stallman sought to replace with free
software—and the development of open source and the Internet. Thus, for
instance, [O’Reilly
claimed](http://www.slideshare.net/timoreilly/the-past-and-future-of-open-computing)
that Unix was built and improved in the spirit of open source because
its academic cheerleaders were already swapping code with each other in
the early 1970s. That such exchanges were just a regular part of the
freewheeling academic culture and had little to do with philosophical
attitudes toward code doesn’t weaken the argument; in fact, this is
recast as an advantage, as now the open source model can be presented as
just a natural extension of the scientific method. (Since O’Reilly
himself played an important role in the production of Unix manuals, his
own contribution to the Internet and open source suddenly looks even
more significant.)

But O’Reilly’s meme-engineering around Unix doesn’t just stop at the
purely discursive level. In his [talks and
writings](http://www.oreillynet.com/network/2000/06/09/java_keynote.html),
O’Reilly often points to one highly technical 1984 book—*The Unix
Programming Environment*—as proof that, at least with respect to
collaboration, Unix was some kind of proto-Internet. Indeed, the
[Wikipedia page for the
book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment)
states that “the book is perhaps most valuable for its exposition of the
Unix philosophy of small cooperating tools with standardized inputs and
outputs, a philosophy that also shaped the end-to-end philosophy of the
Internet. It is this philosophy, and the architecture based on it, that
has allowed open source projects to be assembled into larger systems
such as Linux, without explicit coordination between developers.”

Could it be that O’Reilly is right in claiming that “open source” has a
history that predates 1998? Well, Wikipedia won’t tell us much here: in
a[recent Berkeley talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D3_2iCldUA),
O’Reilly admitted that he was the one to edit the Wikipedia page for the
book. O’Reilly is perfectly positioned to control our technology
discourse: as a publisher, he can churn out whatever books he needs to
promote his favorite memes—and, once those have been codified in book
form, they can be easily admitted into Wikipedia, where they quickly
morph into facts. What’s not to like about “collective intelligence”?

[![b22\_fisher7\_techspeak\_308](The%20Meme%20Hustler%20-%20The%20Baffler_files/b22_fisher7_techspeak_308.png)](http://www.marksfisher.com/)Or
take O’Reilly’s meme-engineering efforts around cyberwarfare. In a
[recent
post](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/07/some-sideways-thinking-about-cyberwarfare.html)
on the subject, he muses on just how narrowly we have defined the idea
of “cyberwarfare” and suggests we expand it to encompass conflicts
between states and individuals. Now, who stands to benefit from
“cyberwarfare” being defined more broadly? Could it be those who, like
O’Reilly, can’t currently grab a share of the giant pie that is
cybersecurity funding? If O’Reilly’s meme-engineering efforts succeed,
we might end up classifying acts that should be treated as crime,
espionage, or terrorism under the ambiguous label of “war.” Such
reframing would be disastrous for civil liberties and privacy and would
only exacerbate the already awful legal prosecution of hacktivists. It
probably won’t be long before a “cyberwarfare correspondent” is added to
O’Reilly’s media empire.Seen through the prism of meme-engineering,
O’Reilly’s activities look far more sinister. His “correspondents” at
*O’Reilly Radar* don’t work beats; they work memes and epistemes,
constantly reframing important public issues in accordance with the
templates prophesied by O’Reilly. Recently, for example, O’Reilly has
been interested in the meme of “[the industrial
Internet](http://radar.oreilly.com/tag/industrial-internet),” forming a
partnership with GE to participate in events and cover the company on
the blog. Once “the industrial Internet” meme is out of the bag, only a
lack of imagination prevents O’Reilly’s writers from seeing it
absolutely everywhere. Here is how [one of them
describes](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/12/the-industrial-internet-from-a-startup-perspective.html)
a company that might not otherwise fit the boundaries of the meme: “I’m
sure \[its founder\] wouldn’t use the words ‘industrial Internet’ to
describe what he and his team are doing, and it might be a little bit of
a stretch to categorize 3Scan that way. But I think they are an exemplar
of many of the core principles of the meme and it’s interesting to think
about them in that frame.” Five years down the road, would you be
surprised if there is, in fact, something called “the industrial
Internet” and that the primary goal of most activism around it is to
defend the freedom of GE to “innovate” on it as it pleases?

In his 2007 bestseller *Words That Work*, the Republican operative Frank
Luntz lists ten rules of effective communication: simplicity, brevity,
credibility, consistency, novelty, sound, aspiration, visualization,
questioning, and context. O’Reilly, while employing most of them, has a
few unique rules of his own. Clever use of visualization, for example,
helps him craft his message in a way that is both sharp and open-ended.
Thus, O’Reilly’s meme-engineering efforts usually result in “meme maps,”
where the meme to be defined—whether it’s “open source” or “Web 2.0”—is
put at the center, while other blob-like terms are drawn as connected to
it.

The exact nature of these connections is rarely explained in full, but
this is all for the better, as the reader might eventually interpret
connections with their own agendas in mind. This is why the name of the
meme must be as inclusive as possible: you never know who your eventual
allies might be. “A big part of meme engineering is giving a name that
creates a big tent that a lot of people want to be under, a train that
takes a lot of people where they want to go,” [writes
O’Reilly](http://www.slideshare.net/timoreilly/language-is-a-map-pdf-with-notes).
Once the meme has been conceived, the rest of O’Reilly’s empire can step
in and help make it real. His conferences, for example, play a crucial
role: “When you look at any of our events, there’s ultimately some
rewriting of the meme map in each of them. *Web 2.0* was about
distinguishing companies that survived the dotcom bust from those that
didn’t. *Strata* is about defining the new field of data science.
*Velocity* is about making clear that the applications of the web depend
on people to keep them running, unlike past generations of software that
were simply software artifacts.”

There is considerable continuity across O’Reilly’s memes—over time, they
tend to morph into one another. Thus, [as he puts
it](http://oreilly.com/pub/wlg/3017), “‘open source’ was a great
reshaping of the meme for its day, moving us off some of the limitations
of ‘free software,’ but it may not be the end of the story.” O’Reilly
has gradually lost interest in “open source” and “Web 2.0,” moving on to
new memes: “government as a platform” and “algorithmic regulation.” We
can only guess what comes next. Such dexterity not only helps in
organizing new events and investing in cool start-ups; it also, as those
six thousand papers that cite Web 2.0 attest, leaves a huge imprint on
our culture.

<span class="dropcap">A</span>ll the familiar pathologies of O’Reilly’s
thinking are on full display in his quest to [meme-engineer his
way](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html)
to “Government 2.0.” The free software scenario is repeating itself:
deeply political reform efforts are no longer seen as “moral crusades,”
but are reinvented as mere attempts at increasing efficiency and
promoting innovation.

Before O’Reilly went searching for a big-tent meme, there was little
cohesion to the many disparate efforts to use technology to transform
government. Some hoped that digitization would help reduce bureaucracy
and allow everyone to fill out tax returns online. Others awaited the
arrival of electronic town halls that would permit citizens to
deliberate on the substance of policies that affect them. Yet another
group hoped that digitization might make governments more transparent
and accountable by forcing them to put some of the documents obtained
through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) online. Finally, there
were those who believed that increasing the availability and liquidity
of government information would lead to new entrepreneurial projects and
boost the economy.

Many of these efforts started long before the web and had no obvious
connection to Internet culture, let alone Web 2.0. Occasionally, these
four efforts—aiming at greater efficiency, deliberation, transparency,
and innovation—overlapped, but mostly they have been driven by two very
different agendas. One cohort, interested in increasing efficiency and
spurring innovation, pursued campaigns that were mostly economic in
character; these folks were not particularly interested in the political
nature of the regimes they were seeking to reform. Singapore—where
anyone can file their paperwork in minutes—was their role model.

The other cohort, interested in deliberation and transparency, was
primarily concerned with transferring power from governments to citizens
and increasing the accountability of public institutions. They argued
that citizens have a right to obtain information about how their
governments operate. Such explicitly political demands became the
cornerstone of various Right to Information campaigns. This second group
wouldn’t accept authoritarian Singapore as a role model, since most of
its e-innovations do very little to promote meaningful citizen
participation in policy-making or increase accountability.

Most modern governments, not surprisingly, prefer the economic aspects
of digitization reform to the political ones. Innovative schemes, like
smart parking systems, can help at election time; lengthy disclosures of
government deliberations are likely to cause headaches. Right-leaning
governments have an extra reason to celebrate the economism of the first
cohort: publishing aggregate information about the performance of
individual public service providers may help convince the electorate
that those services should be provided by the private sector.

> it, our reason.

By the early 2000s, as O’Reilly and his comrades were celebrating open
source as a new revolutionary approach to everything, their discussions
wandered into debates about the future of governance. Thus, a term like
“open government”—which, until then, had mostly been used as a synonym
for “transparent and accountable government”—was reinvented as a
shortened version of “open source government.” The implication of this
subtle linguistic change was that the main cultural attributes of open
source software—the availability of the source code for everyone’s
inspection, the immense contribution it can make to economic growth, the
new decentralized production model that relies on contributions from
numerous highly distributed participants—were to displace older criteria
like “transparency” or “accountability” as the most desirable attributes
of open government. The coining of the “open government” buzzwords was
meant to produce a very different notion of openness.

Initially, O’Reilly had little role in this process; the meme of “open
source” was promiscuous enough to redefine many important terms without
his intervention. But in 2007, O’Reilly [hosted yet another
summit](http://www.opengovdata.org/), attended by technologists and
civic hackers, to devise a list of key principles of open government.
The group came up with [eight
principles](https://public.resource.org/8_principles.html), all focused
on the purely technical issue of how to ensure that, once data was
released by the government, nothing would hold it back. As long as this
“open data” was liquid and reusable, others could build on it. Neither
the political process that led to the release of the data nor its
content was considered relevant to openness. Thus, data about how many
gum-chewers Singapore sends to prison would be “open” as long as the
Singaporean government shared it in suitable formats. Why it shared such
data was irrelevant.

With Obama’s election, Washington was game for all things 2.0. This is
when O’Reilly turned his full attention to government reform, deploying
and manipulating several memes at once—“Gov 2.0,” “open government,” and
“government as a platform”—in order to establish the semantic primacy of
the economic dimension of digitization. A decade earlier, O’Reilly had
redefined “freedom” as the freedom of developers to do as they wished;
now it was all about recasting “openness” in government in purely
economic and innovation-friendly terms while downplaying its political
connotations.

O’Reilly’s writings on Gov 2.0 reveal the same talented meme-engineer
who gave us open source and Web 2.0. In his [seminal essay on the
subject](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html),
O’Reilly mixes semantic environments without a shred of regret. Both Web
2.0 and Gov 2.0, he argues, return us to earlier, simpler ways, away
from the unnecessary complexity of modern institutions. “Web 2.0 was not
a new version of the World Wide Web; it was a renaissance after the dark
ages of the dotcom bust, a rediscovery of the power hidden in the
original design of the World Wide Web,” he writes. “Similarly,
Government 2.0 is not a new kind of government; it is government
stripped down to its core, rediscovered and reimagined as if for the
first time.”

Once it’s been established that new paradigms of government can be
modeled on the success of technology companies, O’Reilly can argue that
“it’s important to think deeply about what the three design principles
of transparency, participation, and collaboration mean in the context of
technology.” These were the very three principles that the Obama
administration articulated in its “Open Government Directive,” published
on the president’s first day in office. But why do we have to think
about their meaning in “the context of technology”? The answer is quite
simple: whatever transparency and participation used to mean doesn’t
matter any longer. Now that we’ve moved to an era of Everything 2.0, the
meaning of those terms will be dictated by the possibilities and
inclinations of technology. And what is technology today if not “open
source” and “Web 2.0”?

Here, for example, is how O’Reilly tries to reengineer the meme of
transparency:

> The word “transparency” can lead us astray as we think about the
> opportunity for Government 2.0. Yes, it’s a good thing when government
> data is available so that journalists and watchdog groups like the
> Sunlight Foundation can disclose cost overruns in government projects
> or highlight the influence of lobbyists. But that’s just the
> beginning. The magic of open data is that the same openness that
> enables transparency also enables innovation, as developers build
> applications that reuse government data in unexpected ways.
> Fortunately, Vivek Kundra and others in the administration understand
> this distinction, and are providing data for both purposes.

Vivek Kundra is the former chief information officer of the U.S.
government who oversaw the launch of a portal called data.gov, which
required agencies to upload at least three “high-value” sets of their
own data. This data was made “open” in the same sense that open source
software is open—i.e., it was made available for anyone to see. But,
once again, O’Reilly is dabbling in meme-engineering: the data dumped on
data.gov, while potentially beneficial for innovation, does not
automatically “enable transparency.” O’Reilly deploys the highly
ambiguous concept of openness to confuse “transparency as
accountability” (what Obama called for in his directive) with
“transparency as innovation” (what O’Reilly himself wants).

How do we ensure accountability? Let’s forget about databases for a
moment and think about power. How do we make the government feel the
heat of public attention? Perhaps by forcing it to make targeted
disclosures of particularly sensitive data sets. Perhaps by
strengthening the FOIA laws, or at least making sure that government
agencies comply with existing provisions. Or perhaps by funding
intermediaries that can build narratives around data—much of the
released data is so complex that few amateurs have the processing power
and expertise to read and make sense of it in their basements. This
might be very useful for boosting accountability but useless for
boosting innovation; likewise, you can think of many data releases that
would be great for innovation and do nothing for accountability. The
language of “openness” does little to help us grasp key differences
between the two. In this context, openness leads to Neil Postman’s
“crazy talk,” resulting in the pollution of the values of one semantic
environment (accountability) with those of another (innovation).

O’Reilly doesn’t always coin new words. Sometimes he manipulates the
meanings of existing words. Cue his framing of “participation”:

> We can be misled by the notion of participation to think that it’s
> limited to having government decision-makers “get input” from
> citizens. This would be like thinking that enabling comments on a
> website is the beginning and end of social media! It’s a trap for
> outsiders to think that Government 2.0 is a way to use new technology
> to amplify the voices of citizens to influence those in power, and by
> insiders as a way to harness and channel those voices to advance their
> causes.

It’s hard to make sense of this passage without understanding the exact
meaning of a term like “participation” in the glossary of All Things Web
2.0. According to O’Reilly, one of the key attributes of Web 2.0 sites
is that they are based on an “[architecture of
participation](http://oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/articles/architecture_of_participation.html)”;
it’s this architecture that allows “collective intelligence” to be
harnessed. Ranking your purchases on Amazon or reporting spammy emails
to Google are good examples of clever architectures of participation.
Once Amazon and Google start learning from millions of users, they
become “smarter” and more attractive to the original users.

This is a very limited vision of participation. It amounts to no more
than a simple feedback session with whoever is running the system. You
are not participating in the design of that system, nor are you asked to
comment on its future. There is nothing “collective” about such
distributed intelligence; it’s just a bunch of individual users acting
on their own and never experiencing any sense of solidarity or group
belonging. Such “participation” has no political dimension; no power
changes hands.

Occasionally, O’Reilly’s illustrations include activities that demand no
actual awareness of participation—e.g., a blog that puts up links to
other blogs ends up improving Google’s search index—which is, not
coincidentally perhaps, how we think of “participation” in the market
system when we go shopping. To imply that “participation” means the same
thing in the context of Web 2.0 as it does in politics is to do the very
opposite of what Korzybski and general semantics prescribe. Were he
really faithful to those principles, O’Reilly would be pointing out the
differences between the two—not blurring them.

So what are we to make of O’Reilly’s exhortation that “it’s a trap for
outsiders to think that Government 2.0 is a way to use new technology to
amplify the voices of citizens to influence those in power”? We might
think that the hallmark of successful participatory reforms would be
enabling citizens to “influence those in power.” There’s a very explicit
depoliticization of participation at work here. O’Reilly wants to
redefine participation from something that arises from shared grievances
and aims at structural reforms to something that arises from individual
frustration with bureaucracies and usually ends with citizens using or
building apps to solve their own problems.

> There is nothing “collective” about Amazon’s distributed intelligence;
> it’s just a bunch of individual users acting on their own.

As a result, once-lively debates about the content and meaning of
specific reforms and institutions are replaced by governments calling on
their citizens to help find spelling mistakes in patent applications or
use their phones to report potholes. If Participation 1.0 was about the
use of public reason to push for political reforms, with groups of
concerned citizens coalescing around some vague notion of the shared
public good, Participation 2.0 is about atomized individuals finding or
contributing the right data to solve some problem without creating any
disturbances in the system itself. (These citizens do come together at
“hackathons”—to help Silicon Valley liberate government data at no
cost—only to return to their bedrooms shortly thereafter.) Following the
open source model, citizens are invited to find bugs in the system, not
to ask whether the system’s goals are right to begin with. That politics
can aspire to something more ambitious than bug-management is not an
insight that occurs after politics has been reimagined through the prism
of open source software.

Protest is one activity that [O’Reilly hates
passionately](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/04/change-we-need-diy-civic-scale.html).
“There’s a kind of passivity even to our activism: we think that all we
can do is to protest,” he writes. “Collective action has come to mean
collective complaint. Or at most, a collective effort to raise money.”
In contrast, he urges citizens to “apply the DIY spirit on a civic
scale.” To illustrate the DIY spirit in action, O’Reilly [likes to
invoke](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/04/change-we-need-diy-civic-scale.html)
the example of a Hawaiian community that, following a period of
government inaction, raised \$4 million and repaired a local park
essential to its livelihood. For O’Reilly, the Hawaiian example reveals
the natural willingness of ordinary citizens to solve their own
problems. Governments should learn from Hawaii and offload more work
onto their citizens; this is the key insight behind O’Reilly’s
“government as a platform” meme.

This platform meme was, of course, inspired by Silicon Valley. Instead
of continuing to build its own apps, Apple built an App Store, getting
third-party developers to do all the heavy lifting. This is the model
that governments must emulate. In fact, notes O’Reilly, they once did:
in the 1950s, the U.S. government built a system of highways that
allowed the private sector to build many more settlements around them,
while in the 1980s the Reagan administration started opening up the GPS
system, which gave us amazing road directions and Foursquare (where
O’Reilly is an investor).

O’Reilly’s prescriptions, as is often the case, do contain a grain of
truth, but he nearly always exaggerates their benefits while obfuscating
their costs. One of the main reasons why governments choose not to
offload certain services to the private sector is not because they think
they can do a better job at innovation or efficiency but because other
considerations—like fairness and equity of access—come into play. “If
Head Start were a start-up it would be out of business. It doesn’t
work,” remarked O’Reilly in a [recent
interview](http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/interviews-profiles).
Well, exactly: that’s why Head Start is not a start-up.

The real question is not whether developers should be able to submit
apps to the App Store, but whether citizens should be paying for the
apps or counting on the government to provide these services. To push
for the platform metaphor as the primary way of thinking about the
distribution of responsibilities between the private and the public
sectors is to push for the economic-innovative dimension of Gov 2.0—and
ensure that the private sector always emerges victorious.

O’Reilly defines “government as a platform” as “the notion that the best
way to shrink the size of government is to introduce the idea that
government should provide fewer citizen-facing services, but should
instead consciously provide infrastructure only, with APIs and standards
that let the private sector deliver citizen facing services.” [He
believes
that](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html)
“the idea of government as a platform applies to every aspect of the
government’s role in society”—city affairs, health care, financial
services regulation, police, fire, and garbage collection. “\[Government
as a platform\] is the right way to frame the question of Government
2.0.”

One person who is busy turning the “government as a platform” meme into
reality is David Cameron in the U.K. Cameron’s “[Big
Society](http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/big-society-speech/)” idea is
based on three main tenets: decentralization of power from London to
local governments, making information about the public sector more
transparent to citizens, and paying providers of public services based
on the quality of their service, which, ideally, would be measured and
published online, thanks to feedback provided by the public. The idea
here is that the government will serve as a coordinator of sorts,
allowing people to come together—perhaps even giving them seed funding
to kick-start alternatives to inefficient public services.

> Once-lively debates about reform are replaced by governments calling
> on their citizens to use their phones to report potholes.

Cameron’s motivation is clear: the government simply has no money to pay
for services that were previously provided by public institutions, and
besides, shrinking the government is something his party has been
meaning to do anyway. Cameron immediately grasped the strategic
opportunities offered by the ambiguity of a term like “open government”
and embraced it wholeheartedly—in its most apolitical, economic version,
of course. At the same time that he celebrated the ability of “[armchair
auditors](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1345777/David-Cameron-Armchair-auditors-leave-councils-hide.html)”
to pore through government databases, he also criticized freedom of
information laws, alleging that FOI requests are “[furring up the
arteries of
government](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9149322/What-price-freedom-of-information.html)”
and even threatening to start charging for them. Francis Maude, the Tory
politician who Cameron put in charge of liberating government data, is
[on the record
stating](http://ci-journal.net/index.php/ciej/article/view/845) that
open government is “what modern deregulation looks like” and that he’d
“like to make FOI redundant.” In 2011, Cameron’s government released a
white paper on “[Open Public
Services](http://www.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/)” that
uses the word “open” in a peculiar way: it argues that, save for
national security and the judiciary, all public services must become
open to competition from the market.

Here’s just one example of how a government that is nominally promoting
Tim O’Reilly’s progressive agenda of Gov 2.0 and “government as a
platform” is rolling back the welfare state and increasing government
secrecy—all in the name of “openness.” The reason why Cameron has
managed to get away with so much crazy talk is simple: the positive spin
attached to “openness” allows his party to hide the ugly nature of its
reforms. O’Reilly, who had [otherwise
praised](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIlxdpfu71o) the Government
Digital Service, the unit responsible for the digitization of the
British government, is aware that the “Big Society” might reveal the
structural limitations of his quest for “openness.” Thus, he publicly
[distanced himself from
Cameron](http://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/2012/05/open-data-movement-redux-tribes-and-contradictions.html),
complaining of “the shabby abdication of responsibility of Cameron’s Big
Society.”

But is this the same O’Reilly who [once claimed
that](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html)
the goal of his proposed reforms is to “design programs and supporting
infrastructure that enable ‘we the people’ to do most of the work”? His
rejection of Cameron is pure PR, as they largely share the same
agenda—not an easy thing to notice, as O’Reilly constantly alternates
between two visions of open government. O’Reilly the good cop claims
that he wants the government to release its data to promote more
innovation by the private sector, while O’Reilly the bad cop wants to
use that newly liberated data to shrink the government. “There is no
Schumpeterian ‘creative destruction’ to bring unneeded government
programs to an end,” [he lamented in
2010](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html).
“Government 2.0 will require deep thinking about how to end programs
that no longer work, and how to use the platform power of the government
not to extend government’s reach, but instead, how to use it to better
enable its citizenry and its economy.” [Speaking to British civil
servants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIlxdpfu71o), O’Reilly
positions open government as the right thing to do in times of
austerity, not just as an effective way to promote innovation.

After *The New Yorker* ran a [long, critical
article](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/25/101025fa_fact_collins)
on the Big Society in 2010, Jennifer Pahlka—O’Reilly’s key ally, who
runs an NGO called Code for America—quickly [moved to
dismiss](http://codeforamerica.org/2010/10/29/the-challenges-of-do-it-ourselves-dio-government/)
any parallels between Cameron and O’Reilly. “The beauty of the
government as a platform model is that it doesn’t assume civic
participation, it encourages it subtly by aligning with existing
motivations in its citizens, so that anyone—ranging from the fixers in
Hawaii to the cynics in Britain—would be willing to get involved,” she
noted in a blog post. “We’d better be careful we don’t send the wrong
message, and that when we’re building tools for citizen engagement, we
do it in the way that taps existing motivations.”

But what kinds of “existing motivations” are there to be tapped?
O’Reilly writes that, in [his ideal
future](http://codeforamerica.org/2010/10/29/the-challenges-of-do-it-ourselves-dio-government/#comment-92778371),
governments will be “making smart design decisions, which harness the
self-interest of society and citizens to achieve positive results.”
That, in fact, is how his favorite technology platforms work: users tell
Google that some of their incoming email is spam in order to improve
their own email experience. In other words, it’s self-interest through
and through. “The architecture of Linux, the Internet, and the World
Wide Web are such that users pursuing their own ‘selfish’ interests
build collective value as an automatic byproduct,” [writes
O’Reilly](http://oreilly.com/lpt/a/6228). This is also how the likes of
Eric Raymond explain the motivation of those contributing to open source
projects—they do it for strictly selfish reasons. “The ‘utility
function’ Linux hackers are maximizing is not classically economic, but
is the intangible of their own ego satisfaction and reputation among
other hackers,” [Raymond
writes](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s11.html)
in *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*. He goes on to say that “one may call
their motivation ‘altruistic’, but this ignores the fact that altruism
is itself a form of ego satisfaction for the altruist.” If it sounds
like Ayn Rand, that’s because Raymond [explicitly draws on her crazy
talk](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/ar01s10.html).

When pressed, O’Reilly the good cop refuses to acknowledge that his
thinking about open government is not very different from Raymond’s
thinking about open source software. When earlier this year Nathaniel
Tkacz, a media academic, [noted these
similarities](http://www.aeonmagazine.com/world-views/nathaniel-tkacz-open-source-government/),
O’Reilly complained that he was “a bit surprised to learn that my ideas
of ‘government as a platform’ are descended from Eric Raymond’s ideas
about Linux, since: a) Eric is a noted libertarian with disdain for
government b) Eric’s focus on Linux was on its software development
methodology.” Well, perhaps O’Reilly shouldn’t act so surprised: as
Tkacz points out, O’Reilly’s writings on “government as a platform”
explicitly credit Raymond as the source of the metaphor. [O’Reilly in
2011](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html):
“In *The Cathedral & the Bazaar*, Eric Raymond uses the image of a
bazaar to contrast the collaborative development model of open source
software with traditional software development, but the analogy is
equally applicable to government.”

But is it really? Applied to politics, all this talk of bazaars,
existing motivations, and self-interest treats citizenship as if it were
fully reducible to market relations—yet another form of crazy talk. And
it doesn’t easily square with the aspirations to active citizenship
implicit in the “DIY spirit on a civic scale.” Of course, with some
clever PR, one can say that the Hawaiians who rebuilt their park had
some “existing motivations,” like having to earn a living to stay alive.
But if the bar for “existing motivations” is set so low, then there are
no limits to dismantling the welfare state and replacing it with some
wild DIY hacker culture. Why do we need an expensive health care system
if people have “existing motivations” to self-monitor at home and
purchase drugs directly from Big Pharma? Why bother with police if we
can print out guns at home—thanks, 3-D printers!—and we are already
highly motivated to stay alive?

Once we follow [O’Reilly’s
exhortation](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/04/change-we-need-diy-civic-scale.html)
not to treat the government as “the deus ex machina that we’ve paid to
do for us what we could be doing for ourselves,” such questions are hard
to avoid. In all of O’Reilly’s theorizing, there’s not a hint as to what
political and moral principles should guide us in applying the platform
model. Whatever those principles are, they are certainly not exhausted
by appeals to innovation and efficiency—which is the language that
O’Reilly wants us to speak.

> O’Reilly is perfectly positioned to control our technology discourse:
> he can churn out whatever books he needs to promote his favorite
> memes.

The fundamental problem with O’Reilly’s vision is that, on the one hand,
it’s all about having the private sector build new services that were
unavailable when the government ran the show. Thus, it’s all about
citizen-consumers, guided by the Invisible Hand, creating new value out
of thin air. But O’Reilly also likes to invoke “DIY spirit on a civic
scale” to call on citizens to take on functions that were previously
performed by the government (even if poorly); here, we are not building
new services—we are outsourcing public services to the private sector.
O’Reilly’s logic in a nutshell: the government didn’t have to build its
own Foursquare—hence, disaster response should be delegated to the
private sector. Is the government meant to be a platform for providing
services or for stimulating innovation? It’s certainly both—but the
principles that ought to regulate its behavior in each case are
certainly different.

For O’Reilly, the memes of “Government 2.0” and “government as a
platform” serve one major function: they make him relevant to the
conversation about governance and politics, allowing him to expand his
business into new territories. The Internet and open source have become
universal connectors that can relate anything to anything. “Just as the
interstate highway system increased the vitality of our transportation
infrastructure, it is certainly possible that greater government
involvement in health care could do the same,” [he
writes](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html).
Got it? But what if the dynamics of building highways are different from
those of providing health care? What then?

<span class="dropcap">O</span>’Reilly’s attempts to meme-engineer how we
think about politics are all the more disturbing for the deeply
reductionist, anti-democratic flavor of his own politics. Positivist to
his core, O’Reilly believes that there is just one right answer to
policy dilemmas, and that it’s the job of the government (for him, it’s
all just “government”) to produce legislation that gets at this “right”
answer and then pass the necessary measures to make it happen. The means
don’t much matter; it’s all about the ends—and the ends are perfectly
knowable, as long as we have the data.

O’Reilly’s latest meme, which he calls “[algorithmic
regulation](https://plus.google.com/+TimOReilly/posts/CPiAX9YiVUB),” was
inspired by—what else?—the Internet. This idea, writes O’Reilly, “is
central to all Internet platforms, and provides a fruitful area for
investigation in the design of 21st century government.” This is how he
explained it in a [recent
talk](http://longnow.org/seminars/02012/sep/05/birth-global-mind/) at
the Long Now Foundation:

> If you look at, say, the way spam is regulated on the Internet, that’s
> the beginnings of a kind of an immune system response to a pathogen
> and works a lot like biology: you recognize the signature of something
> new and hostile and you fix it. . . . You compare that to how
> government regulation works, and you go: “It’s just badly broken!”
> Somebody puts out some rules, and there’s no method of enforcement.

Not a very sharp definition yet, but this is how many of O’Reilly’s
memes start. Once he’s cornered the meme, his “correspondents” will do
the rest, highlighting it in their blog posts and reports. (“In the
future, better outcomes might come . . . through adopting what Tim
O’Reilly has described as ‘algorithmic regulation,’ applying the dynamic
feedback loops that web giants use to police their systems against
malware and spam in government agencies entrusted with protecting the
public interest,” [writes Alex
Howard](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/07/rethinking-regulatory-reform-in-the-internet-age.html),
the “Government 2.0” correspondent of *O’Reilly Radar*.)

Quite appropriately, the only political institution that corresponds to
O’Reilly’s vision for “algorithmic regulation” is a central bank.
Central banks have very clear, numerical targets—they know what’s
“right” and don’t have to bother with deliberations—and they try to meet
those targets with just a few specific tools at their disposal. They
love feedback and think like Google. According to O’Reilly, the way they
regulate is “kind of like the way Google regulates. They kind of say: I
have an outcome in mind and a couple of knobs and levers. Periodically,
I might get a few new knobs and levers, and I tweak them to get the
outcome. I don’t just sort of say: This is a rule and I’m going to
follow it regardless of whether it has a good outcome or a bad outcome.”
Central banks are elegant and simple; they just do stuff, instead of
succumbing to, well, politics. “\[In central banks\] we have a couple of
levers, and we keep tweaking them to see if we can get where we want to
go. And that’s really how I would like to see us thinking about
government regulatory processes.”

Expanding on this notion of “algorithmic regulation,” O’Reilly reveals
his inner technocrat:

> I remember having a conversation with Nancy Pelosi not long after
> Google did their Panda search update, and it was in the context of
> SOPA/PIPA. . . . \[Pelosi\] said, “Well, you know, we have to satisfy
> the interests of the technology industry *and* the movie industry.”
> And I thought, “No, you don’t. You have to get the right answer.” So
> that’s the reason I mentioned Google Panda search update, when they

> get it right!” And I feel like, we don’t actually have a government
> that actually understands that it has to be building a better platform
> that starts to manage things like that with the best outcome for the
> real users. *\[loud applause\]*

Here O’Reilly dismisses the entertainment industry as just “wrong,”
essentially comparing them to spammers. But what makes Google an
appropriate model here? While it has obligations to its shareholders,
Google doesn’t owe anything to the sites in its index. Congress was
never meant to work this way. SOPA and PIPA were bad laws with too much
overreach, but to claim that the entertainment industry has no
legitimate grievances against piracy seems bizarre.

Underpinning O’Reilly’s faith in algorithmic regulation is his naive
belief that big data, harnessed through collective intelligence, would
allow us to get at the right answer to every problem, making both
representation and deliberation unnecessary. After all, why let
contesting factions battle it out in the public sphere if we can just
study what happens in the real world—with our sensors, databases, and
algorithms? No wonder O’Reilly ends up claiming that “we have to
actually start moving away from the notion that politics really has very
much to do with governance. To the extent that we can fix things without
politics, we’d be much better off.” It’s the ultimate conceit of Silicon
Valley: if only we had more data and better tools, we could suspend
politics once and for all.

The magic “feedback” that O’Reilly touts so passionately is really the
voice of the market—and [occasionally he lets that
slip](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html):
“Government programs must be designed from the outset not as a fixed set
of specifications, but as open-ended platforms that allow for
extensibility and revision by the marketplace. Platform thinking is an
antidote to the complete specifications that currently dominate the
government approach not only to IT but to programs of all kinds.” But we
prefer to have complete specifications at the outset not because no one
had thought of building dynamic feedback systems before O’Reilly but
because this is the only way to ensure that everyone’s grievances are
addressed before the policies are implemented.

His treatment of feedback as essentially an Internet phenomenon is
vintage O’Reilly. As long as “algorithmic regulation” is defined against
a notion like Web 2.0, O’Reilly feels no need to engage with the vast
body of thought on feedback systems and the sociology of performance
indicators. That most of the [ideas behind algorithmic
regulation](http://www.amazon.com/Feedback-Thought-Social-Science-Systems/dp/1883823463)
were articulated by the likes of Karl Deutsch and David Easton in the
1960s would probably be news to O’Reilly. Nor is his intellectual
equilibrium perturbed by the fact that the RAND Corporation was pitching
something very similar to “algorithmic regulation” to American cities in
the late 1960s in the hopes of making city governance [more
cybernetic](http://www.amazon.com/Warfare-Welfare-Defense-Intellectuals-Problems/dp/0801882737).
The plans, alas, didn’t work; the models could never account for the
messy reality of urban life.

A decade before he wrote *Science and Sanity*, Alfred Korzybski wrote
another weird book—[*Manhood of
Humanity*](http://www.amazon.com/Manhood-Humanity-Alfred-Korzybski/dp/1463748000/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1364695542&sr=1-1&keywords=Manhood+of+Humanity).
He, too, was very keen on feedback. “Philosophy, law and ethics, to be
effective in a dynamic world must be dynamic; they must be made vital
enough to keep pace with the progress of life and science,” he
proclaimed. Korzybski’s solution, surprisingly, also lay in turning
government into an algorithmically driven platform: “A natural first
step would probably be the establishment of a new institution which
might be called a Dynamic Department—Department of Coordination or a
Department of Cooperation—the name is of little importance, but it would
be the *nucleus* of the new civilization.” Like O’Reilly’s “government
as a platform,” this new department would aspire to enable citizens.
“Its functions,” wrote Korzybski, “would be those of encouraging,
helping and protecting the people in such cooperative enterprises as
agriculture, manufactures, finance, and distribution.”

Korzybski envisioned this new scientific government to consist of ten
sections, which ranged from the Section of Mathematical Sociology or
Humanology (“composed of at least one sociologist, one biologist, one
mechanical engineer, and one mathematician”) to the Section of
Mathematical Legislation (“composed of (say) one lawyer, one
mathematician, one mechanical engineer”) and from the Promoters’ Section
(“composed of engineers whose duty would be to study all of the latest
scientific facts, collect data, and elaborate plans”) to the News
Section (its task would be “to edit a large daily paper giving true,
uncolored news with a special supplement relating to progress in the
work of Human Engineering”).

For all his insight into the nature of language and reality, Korzybski
was a kooky technocrat who believed that science could resolve all
political problems. He would certainly agree with O’Reilly that there is
one right way to decide on pending legislation and that any issues and
controversies that come up in deliberations are just semantic
noise—clever meme-engineering by the parties involved. Scientism is
still scientism, even when it’s clothed in the rhetoric of big data.

<span class="dropcap">A</span>t least O’Reilly is perfectly clear about
how people can succeed in the future. Toward the end of his Long Now
Foundation talk, he admits that

Yes, let that thought sink in: our Mindstormer-in-Chief is telling us
that the only way to succeed in this brave new world is to become a Tim
O’Reilly. Anyone fancy an O’Reilly manual on meme hustling?
